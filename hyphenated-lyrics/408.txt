# WEEPING MARY

They cru-ci-fied the Sav-ior,
And nailed Him to the cross;

[chorus]
He a-rose,
And as-cend-ed in a cloud.

See, Ma-ry comes a-weep-ing
To see where He was laid;

They crucified the Savior,
And nailed Him to the cross;

[chorus]
He arose,
And ascended in a cloud.

See, Mary comes a-weeping
To see where He was laid;

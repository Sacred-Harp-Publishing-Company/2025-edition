# TORRINGTON

When we in dark-ness walk,
Nor feel the heav’n-ly flame,
Then is the time to trust our God,
And rest up-on His name.

Soon shall our doubts and fears
Sub-side at His con-trol;
His lov-ing-kind-ness shall break through
The mid-night of the soul.

When we in darkness walk,
Nor feel the heav’nly flame,
Then is the time to trust our God,
And rest upon His name.

Soon shall our doubts and fears
Subside at His control;
His loving-kindness shall break through
The midnight of the soul.

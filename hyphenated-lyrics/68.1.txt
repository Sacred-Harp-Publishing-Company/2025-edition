# SALEM

He dies, the friend of sin-ners dies;
Lo, Sa-lem’s daugh-ters weep a-round;
A sol-emn dark-ness veils the skies,
A sud-den trem-bling shakes the ground.

Say, “Live for-ev-er, glo-rious King,
Born to re-deem and strong to save!”
Then ask, “O Death, where is thy sting,
And where thy vic-t’ry, boast-ing Grave?”

He dies, the friend of sinners dies;
Lo, Salem’s daughters weep around;
A solemn darkness veils the skies,
A sudden trembling shakes the ground.

Say, “Live forever, glorious King,
Born to redeem and strong to save!”
Then ask, “O Death, where is thy sting,
And where thy vict’ry, boasting Grave?”

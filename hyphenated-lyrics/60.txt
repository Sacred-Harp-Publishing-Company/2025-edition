# DAY OF WORSHIP

Dear peo-ple, we have met to-day
To sing, to hear, to preach and pray;
It is our Fa-ther’s great com-mand,
The road that leads to His right hand;
But oh, the sad and aw-ful state
Of those who stand and come too late:
The fool-ish vir-gins did be-gin
To knock, but could not en-ter in.

Dear people, we have met today
To sing, to hear, to preach and pray;
It is our Father’s great command,
The road that leads to His right hand;
But oh, the sad and awful state
Of those who stand and come too late:
The foolish virgins did begin
To knock, but could not enter in.

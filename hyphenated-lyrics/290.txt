# VICTORIA

A-las! and did my Sav-ior bleed?
And did my Sov-’reign die?

[chorus]
I have but one more riv-er to cross,
And then I’ll be at rest.

Would He de-vote His sa-cred head
For such a worm as I?

Alas! and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sov’reign die?

[chorus]
I have but one more river to cross,
And then I’ll be at rest.

Would He devote His sacred head
For such a worm as I?

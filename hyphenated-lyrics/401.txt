Go, preach-ers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourn-ers found a home at last.

[chorus]
Through free grace and a dy-ing Lamb,
Poor mourn-ers found a home at last.

Go, fa-thers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourn-ers found a home at last.

Go, moth-ers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourn-ers found a home at last.

------

Go, preachers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourners found a home at last.

[chorus]
Through free grace and a dying Lamb,
Poor mourners found a home at last.

Go, fathers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourners found a home at last.

Go, mothers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourners found a home at last.

# MOONLIGHT

While the em-press of the night
Scat-ters mild her sil-ver light;
While the viv-id plan-ets stray
Var-ious through their mys-tic way;
While the stars un-num-bered roll
Round the ev-er-con-stant pole;
Far a-bove these span-gled skies,
All my soul to God shall rise.

While the empress of the night
Scatters mild her silver light;
While the vivid planets stray
Various through their mystic way;
While the stars unnumbered roll
Round the ever-constant pole;
Far above these spangled skies,
All my soul to God shall rise.

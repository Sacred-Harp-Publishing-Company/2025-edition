# IMMENSITY

With-in Thy cir-cling pow’r I stand;
On ev-’ry side I find Thy hand:
A-wake, a-sleep, at home, a-broad,
I am sur-round-ed still with God.

Lord, Thou hast searched and seen me through;
Thine eye com-mands, with pierc-ing view,
My ris-ing and my rest-ing hours,
My heart and flesh with all their pow’rs.

Within Thy circling pow’r I stand;
On ev’ry side I find Thy hand:
Awake, asleep, at home, abroad,
I am surrounded still with God.

Lord, Thou hast searched and seen me through;
Thine eye commands, with piercing view,
My rising and my resting hours,
My heart and flesh with all their pow’rs.

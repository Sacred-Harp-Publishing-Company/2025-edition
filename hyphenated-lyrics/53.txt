# JERUSALEM

Je-sus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
He whom I fix my hopes up-on;
His track I see, and I’ll pur-sue
The nar-row way till Him I view.

[chorus]
I’m on my jour-ney home to the new Je-ru-sa-lem,
So fare you well;
I am go-ing home.

The way the ho-ly pro-phets went,
The road that leads from ban-ish-ment,
The King’s high-way of ho-li-ness
I’ll go, for all His paths are peace.

This is the way I long have sought,
And mourned be-cause I found it not;
My grief a bur-den long has been,
Be-cause I was not saved from sin.

Then will I tell to sin-ners round
What a dear Sav-ior I have found;
I’ll point to Thy re-deem-ing blood,
And say, “Be-hold the way to God!”

Lo! glad I come, and Thou, blest Lamb,
Shalt take me to Thee, whose I am;
Noth-ing but sin have I to give,
Noth-ing but love shall I re-ceive.

Jesus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
He whom I fix my hopes upon;
His track I see, and I’ll pursue
The narrow way till Him I view.

[chorus]
I’m on my journey home to the new Jerusalem,
So fare you well;
I am going home.

The way the holy prophets went,
The road that leads from banishment,
The King’s highway of holiness
I’ll go, for all His paths are peace.

This is the way I long have sought,
And mourned because I found it not;
My grief a burden long has been,
Because I was not saved from sin.

Then will I tell to sinners round
What a dear Savior I have found;
I’ll point to Thy redeeming blood,
And say, “Behold the way to God!”

Lo! glad I come, and Thou, blest Lamb,
Shalt take me to Thee, whose I am;
Nothing but sin have I to give,
Nothing but love shall I receive.

Hark! from the tombs a dole-ful sound;
Mine ears, at-tend the cry,
“Ye liv-ing men, come view the ground
Where you must short-ly lie.”

Great God! is this our cer-tain doom?
And are we still se-cure?
Still walk-ing down-ward to the tomb,
And yet pre-pared no more!

Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound;
Mine ears, attend the cry,
“Ye living men, come view the ground
Where you must shortly lie.”

Great God! is this our certain doom?
And are we still secure?
Still walking downward to the tomb,
And yet prepared no more!

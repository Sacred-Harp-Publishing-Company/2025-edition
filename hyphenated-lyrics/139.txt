# ELYSIAN

Burst, ye em-erald gates, and bring
To my rap-tured vi-sion
All th’ec-sta-tic joys that spring
Round the bright e-ly-sian.
Lo, we lift our long-ing eyes;
Burst, ye in-ter-ven-ing skies!
Sun of right-eous-ness, a-rise;
Ope the gates of Par-a-dise.

Floods of ev-er-last-ing light
Free-ly flash be-fore Him;
My-riads, with su-preme de-light,
In-stant-ly a-dore Him.
An-gel trumps re-sound His fame,
Lutes of lu-cid gold pro-claim
All the mu-sic of His name,
Heav-en ech-o-ing the theme.

Four and twen-ty eld-ers rise
From their prince-ly sta-tion,
Shout His glo-rious vic-to-ries,
Sing the great sal-va-tion,
Cast their crowns be-fore His throne,
Cry in rev-er-en-tial tone,
“Glo-ry give to God a-lone,
Ho-ly, ho-ly, ho-ly One!”

------

Burst, ye emerald gates, and bring
To my raptured vision
All th’ecstatic joys that spring
Round the bright elysian.
Lo, we lift our longing eyes;
Burst, ye intervening skies!
Sun of righteousness, arise;
Ope the gates of Paradise.

Floods of everlasting light
Freely flash before Him;
Myriads, with supreme delight,
Instantly adore Him.
Angel trumps resound His fame,
Lutes of lucid gold proclaim
All the music of His name,
Heaven echoing the theme.

Four and twenty elders rise
From their princely station,
Shout His glorious victories,
Sing the great salvation,
Cast their crowns before His throne,
Cry in reverential tone,
“Glory give to God alone,
Holy, holy, holy One!”

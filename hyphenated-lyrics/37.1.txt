# ESTER

A-wake, my soul, in joy-ful lays,
And sing thy great Re-deem-er’s praise;
He just-ly claims a song from me,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, O how free!

Though num-’rous hosts of might-y foes,
Though earth and hell my way op-pose,
He safe-ly leads my soul a-long,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, O how strong!

When trou-ble, like a gloom-y cloud,
Has gath-ered thick and thun-dered loud,
He near my soul has al-ways stood,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, O how good!

Soon shall I pass death’s gloom-y vale,
Soon all my mor-tal pow’rs must fail;
O may my last ex-pir-ing breath
His lov-ing-kind-ness sing in death!

Then let me mount and soar a-way
To that bright world of end-less day,
And sing, with rap-ture and sur-prise,
His lov-ing-kind-ness in the skies.

Awake, my soul, in joyful lays,
And sing thy great Redeemer’s praise;
He justly claims a song from me,
His loving-kindness, O how free!

Though num’rous hosts of mighty foes,
Though earth and hell my way oppose,
He safely leads my soul along,
His loving-kindness, O how strong!

When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has gathered thick and thundered loud,
He near my soul has always stood,
His loving-kindness, O how good!

Soon shall I pass death’s gloomy vale,
Soon all my mortal pow’rs must fail;
O may my last expiring breath
His loving-kindness sing in death!

Then let me mount and soar away
To that bright world of endless day,
And sing, with rapture and surprise,
His loving-kindness in the skies.

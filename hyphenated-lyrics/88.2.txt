O for a thou-sand tongues to sing
My great Re-deem-er’s praise,
The glo-ries of my God and King,
The tri-umphs of His grace!

[chorus]
O Chris-tians, praise Him,
Me-thinks I hear the gos-pel sound-ing
For more vol-un-teers.

Je-sus, the name that calms my fears,
That bids my sor-row cease;
’Tis mu-sic in the sin-ner’s ears;
’Tis life and health and peace.

My gra-cious Mas-ter and my God,
As-sist me to pro-claim,
To spread through all the earth a-broad
The hon-ors of Thy name.

------

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

[chorus]
O Christians, praise Him,
Methinks I hear the gospel sounding
For more volunteers.

Jesus, the name that calms my fears,
That bids my sorrow cease;
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears;
’Tis life and health and peace.

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name.

# GOSPEL TRUMPET

Hark! how the gos-pel trum-pet sounds!
Through all the world the ech-o bounds;
And Je-sus by re-deem-ing blood
Is bring-ing sin-ners home to God,
And guides them safe-ly by His word
To end-less day.

Thy blood, dear Je-sus, once was spilt
To save our souls from sin and guilt,
And sin-ners now may come to God
And find sal-va-tion through Thy blood,
And sail by faith up-on that flood
To end-less day.

Hark! how the gospel trumpet sounds!
Through all the world the echo bounds;
And Jesus by redeeming blood
Is bringing sinners home to God,
And guides them safely by His word
To endless day.

Thy blood, dear Jesus, once was spilt
To save our souls from sin and guilt,
And sinners now may come to God
And find salvation through Thy blood,
And sail by faith upon that flood
To endless day.

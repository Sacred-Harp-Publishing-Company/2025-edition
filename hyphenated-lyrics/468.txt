# SOUL’S DELIGHT

I know that my Re-deem-er lives
And guides me day by day;
He leads me through life’s nar-row road
And hears me when I pray.
I’ll nev-er walk a-lone a-gain,
He is my soul’s de-light;
He set me free from death and sin
To give e-ter-nal life.

I know that my Redeemer lives
And guides me day by day;
He leads me through life’s narrow road
And hears me when I pray.
I’ll never walk alone again,
He is my soul’s delight;
He set me free from death and sin
To give eternal life.

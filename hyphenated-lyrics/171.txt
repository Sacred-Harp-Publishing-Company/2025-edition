# EXHORTATION

Lord, in the morn-ing Thou shalt hear
My voice as-cend-ing high;
To Thee will I di-rect my prayer,
To Thee lift up mine eye.

Up to the hills where Christ is gone
To plead for all His saints,
Pre-sent-ing at His Fa-ther’s throne
Our songs and our com-plaints.

Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear
My voice ascending high;
To Thee will I direct my prayer,
To Thee lift up mine eye.

Up to the hills where Christ is gone
To plead for all His saints,
Presenting at His Father’s throne
Our songs and our complaints.

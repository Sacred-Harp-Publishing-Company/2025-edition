# SWEET MORNING

The hap-py day will soon ap-pear,
And we’ll all shout to-geth-er in that morn-ing.
When Ga-briel’s trum-pet you shall hear,
And we’ll all shout to-geth-er in that morn-ing.

[chorus]
Sweet morn-ing,
And we’ll all shout to-geth-er in that morn-ing.

Be-hold the right-eous march-ing home,
And we’ll all shout to-geth-er in that morn-ing.
And all the an-gels bid them come,
And we’ll all shout to-geth-er in that morn-ing.

------

The happy day will soon appear,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.
When Gabriel’s trumpet you shall hear,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.

[chorus]
Sweet morning,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.

Behold the righteous marching home,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.
And all the angels bid them come,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.

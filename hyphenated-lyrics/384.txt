# PANTING FOR HEAVEN

Oh, when will the pe-riod ap-pear
When I shall u-nite in your song?
I’m wea-ry of lin-ger-ing here,
And I to your Sav-ior be-long.
I’m fet-tered and chained up in clay;
I strug-gle and pant to be free:
I long to be soar-ing a-way,
My God and my Sav-ior to see.

------

Oh, when will the period appear
When I shall unite in your song?
I’m weary of lingering here,
And I to your Savior belong.
I’m fettered and chained up in clay;
I struggle and pant to be free:
I long to be soaring away,
My God and my Savior to see.

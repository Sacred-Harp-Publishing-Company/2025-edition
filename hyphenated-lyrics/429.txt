# RED SANDS

How hap-py is the pil-grim’s lot,
How free from ev-’ry anx-ious thought,
From world-ly hope and fear!
Con-fined to nei-ther court nor cell,
His soul dis-dains on earth to dwell,
He on-ly so-journs here.

How happy is the pilgrim’s lot,
How free from ev’ry anxious thought,
From worldly hope and fear!
Confined to neither court nor cell,
His soul disdains on earth to dwell,
He only sojourns here.

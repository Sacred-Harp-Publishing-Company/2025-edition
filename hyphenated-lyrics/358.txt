# MURILLO’S LESSON

As down a lone val-ley with ce-dars o’er-spread
From war’s dread con-fu-sion I pen-sive-ly strayed,
The gloom from the face of fair heav-en re-tired,
The winds hushed their mur-murs, the thun-ders ex-pired;
Per-fumes as of E-den flowed sweet-ly a-long,
A voice as of an-gels en-chant-ing-ly sung,
Co-lum-bia, Co-lum-bia, to glo-ry a-rise,
The queen of the world and the child of the skies!

As down a lone valley with cedars o’erspread
From war’s dread confusion I pensively strayed,
The gloom from the face of fair heaven retired,
The winds hushed their murmurs, the thunders expired;
Perfumes as of Eden flowed sweetly along,
A voice as of angels enchantingly sung,
Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise,
The queen of the world and the child of the skies!

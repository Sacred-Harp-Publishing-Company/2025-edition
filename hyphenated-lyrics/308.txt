# THE LOST CITY

O when shall I see Je-sus,
And reign with Him a-bove?
And from the flow-ing foun-tain
Drink ev-er-last-ing love?

[chorus]
And to glo-ry I will go.

Through grace I am de-ter-mined
To con-quer, though I die,
And then a-way to Je-sus
On wings of love I’ll fly,

------

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above?
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love?

[chorus]
And to glory I will go.

Through grace I am determined
To conquer, though I die,
And then away to Jesus
On wings of love I’ll fly,

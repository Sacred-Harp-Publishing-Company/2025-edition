# EAGLES’ WINGS

O glo-rious hope of per-fect love!
It lifts me up to things a-bove,
It bears on ea-gles’ wings;
It gives my rap-tured soul a taste,
And makes me for some mo-ments feast
With Je-sus’ priests and kings.

No foot of land do I pos-sess,
No cot-tage in the wil-der-ness,
A poor way-far-ing man;
I lodge a-while in tents be-low,
Or glad-ly wan-der as I go,
Till I my Ca-naan gain.

O glorious hope of perfect love!
It lifts me up to things above,
It bears on eagles’ wings;
It gives my raptured soul a taste,
And makes me for some moments feast
With Jesus’ priests and kings.

No foot of land do I possess,
No cottage in the wilderness,
A poor wayfaring man;
I lodge awhile in tents below,
Or gladly wander as I go,
Till I my Canaan gain.

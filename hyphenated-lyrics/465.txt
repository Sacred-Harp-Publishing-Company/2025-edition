# WHERE THERE’S NO TROUBLE AND SORROW

I have my trou-bles here be-low
As the nar-row way I fol-low,
But there’s a land of peace and rest,
Where there’s no trou-ble or sor-row.
Yes, my loved ones now are o-ver there,
And I know I soon will fol-low,
I’ll see my Sav-ior in that land
Where there’s no trou-ble or sor-row.

------

I have my troubles here below
As the narrow way I follow,
But there’s a land of peace and rest,
Where there’s no trouble or sorrow.
Yes, my loved ones now are over there,
And I know I soon will follow,
I’ll see my Savior in that land
Where there’s no trouble or sorrow.

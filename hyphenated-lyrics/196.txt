# ALABAMA

An-gels in shin-ing or-der stand
A-round the Sav-ior’s throne;
They bow with rev-’rence at His feet,
And make His glo-ries known.
Those hap-py spir-its sing His praise
To all e-ter-ni-ty,
But I can sing re-deem-ing grace,
For Je-sus died for me.

Angels in shining order stand
Around the Savior’s throne;
They bow with rev’rence at His feet,
And make His glories known.
Those happy spirits sing His praise
To all eternity,
But I can sing redeeming grace,
For Jesus died for me.

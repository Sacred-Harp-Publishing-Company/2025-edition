# THOU ART GOD

Be-fore the hills in or-der stood,
Or earth re-ceived her frame,
From ev-er-last-ing Thou art God,
Through end-less years the same.
From ev-er-last-ing Thou art God,
Through end-less years the same.

Un-der the shad-ow of Thy throne,
Still may we dwell se-cure;
Suf-fi-cient is Thine arm a-lone,
And our de-fense is sure.
Suf-fi-cient is Thine arm a-lone,
And our de-fense is sure.

------

Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
Through endless years the same.
From everlasting Thou art God,
Through endless years the same.

Under the shadow of Thy throne,
Still may we dwell secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defense is sure.
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defense is sure.

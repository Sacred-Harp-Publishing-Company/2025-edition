# MAJESTY

The Lord de-scend-ed from a-bove,
And bowed the heav’ns most high;
And un-der-neath His feet He cast
The dark-ness of the sky.
On cher-ubs and on cher-u-bims,
Full roy-al-ly He rode,
And on the wings of might-y winds
Came fly-ing all a-broad.

The Lord descended from above,
And bowed the heav’ns most high;
And underneath His feet He cast
The darkness of the sky.
On cherubs and on cherubims,
Full royally He rode,
And on the wings of mighty winds
Came flying all abroad.

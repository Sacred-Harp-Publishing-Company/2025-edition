# SOUNDING JOY

Be-hold the morn-ing sun
Be-gins his glo-rious way;
His beams through all the na-tions run,
And life and light con-vey.

But when the gos-pel comes
It spreads di-vin-er light;
It calls dead sin-ners from their tombs,
And gives the blind their sight.

My gra-cious God, how plain
Are Thy di-rec-tions giv’n!
Oh, may I nev-er read in vain,
But find the path to heav’n.

Behold the morning sun
Begins his glorious way;
His beams through all the nations run,
And life and light convey.

But when the gospel comes
It spreads diviner light;
It calls dead sinners from their tombs,
And gives the blind their sight.

My gracious God, how plain
Are Thy directions giv’n!
Oh, may I never read in vain,
But find the path to heav’n.

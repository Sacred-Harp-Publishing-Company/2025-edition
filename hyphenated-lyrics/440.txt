# NORTH SALEM

My soul, come med-i-tate the day,
And think how near it stands,
When thou must quit this house of clay,
And fly to un-known lands.

And you, mine eyes, look down and view
The hol-low, gap-ing tomb;
This gloom-y pris-on waits for you
When-e’er the sum-mons come.

My soul, come meditate the day,
And think how near it stands,
When thou must quit this house of clay,
And fly to unknown lands.

And you, mine eyes, look down and view
The hollow, gaping tomb;
This gloomy prison waits for you
Whene’er the summons come.

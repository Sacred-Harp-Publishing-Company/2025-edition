Ye hum-ble souls, com-plain no more;
Let faith sur-vey your fu-ture store;
How hap-py, how di-vine-ly blest,
The sa-cred words of truth at-test!
When con-scious grief la-ments sin-cere,
And pours the pen-i-ten-tial tear,
Hope points to your de-ject-ed eyes
The bright re-ver-sion in the skies.

Ye humble souls, complain no more;
Let faith survey your future store;
How happy, how divinely blest,
The sacred words of truth attest!
When conscious grief laments sincere,
And pours the penitential tear,
Hope points to your dejected eyes
The bright reversion in the skies.

# LEBANON

See, gra-cious God, be-fore Thy throne,
Thy mourn-ing peo-ple bend;
’Tis on Thy sov-’reign grace a-lone,
On Thee our hum-ble hopes de-pend.

How changed, a-las, are truths di-vine,
For er-ror, guilt, and shame!
What im-pious num-bers, bold in sin,
Dis-grace the ho-ly Chris-tian name!

O turn us, turn us, might-y Lord,
By Thy re-sist-less grace;
Then shall our hearts o-bey Thy word,
And hum-bly we shall seek Thy face.

See, gracious God, before Thy throne,
Thy mourning people bend;
’Tis on Thy sov’reign grace alone,
On Thee our humble hopes depend.

How changed, alas, are truths divine,
For error, guilt, and shame!
What impious numbers, bold in sin,
Disgrace the holy Christian name!

O turn us, turn us, mighty Lord,
By Thy resistless grace;
Then shall our hearts obey Thy word,
And humbly we shall seek Thy face.

# CHRISTIAN SOLDIER

Am I a sol-dier of the cross,
A fol-l’wer of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?
Must I be car-ried to the skies
On flow-’ry beds of ease,
While oth-ers fought to win the prize,
And sailed through blood-y seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?
Sure I must fight if I would reign;
In-crease my cour-age, Lord;
I’ll bear the toil, en-dure the pain,
Sup-port-ed by Thy word.

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A foll’wer of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?
Must I be carried to the skies
On flow’ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?
Sure I must fight if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord;
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy word.

# IMANDRA NEW

Fare-well, my dear breth-ren, the time is at hand,
When we must be part-ed from this so-cial band;
Our sev-’ral en-gage-ments now call us a-way;
Our part-ing is need-ful, and we must o-bey.

Farewell, my dear brethren, the time is at hand,
When we must be parted from this social band;
Our sev’ral engagements now call us away;
Our parting is needful, and we must obey.

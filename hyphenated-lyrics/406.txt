# NEW HARMONY

I want to live a Chris-tian here,
I want to die a-shout-ing,
I want to feel my Sav-ior near
While soul and bod-y’s part-ing.
I want to see bright an-gels stand
And wait-ing to re-ceive me,
To bear my soul to Ca-naan’s land,
Where Christ is gone be-fore me.

My heart is of-ten made to mourn
Be-cause I’m faint and fee-ble,
And when my Sav-ior seems to frown,
My soul is filled with trou-ble.
But when He doth a-gain re-turn,
And I re-pent my fol-ly,
’Tis then I af-ter glo-ry run,
And still my Je-sus fol-low.

I have my bit-ter and my sweet
While through this world I trav-el;
Some-times I shout, and of-ten weep,
Which makes my foes to mar-vel.
But let them think, and think a-gain,
I feel I’m bound for heav-en;
I hope I shall with Je-sus reign,
I there-fore still will praise Him.

I want to live a Christian here,
I want to die a-shouting,
I want to feel my Savior near
While soul and body’s parting.
I want to see bright angels stand
And waiting to receive me,
To bear my soul to Canaan’s land,
Where Christ is gone before me.

My heart is often made to mourn
Because I’m faint and feeble,
And when my Savior seems to frown,
My soul is filled with trouble.
But when He doth again return,
And I repent my folly,
’Tis then I after glory run,
And still my Jesus follow.

I have my bitter and my sweet
While through this world I travel;
Sometimes I shout, and often weep,
Which makes my foes to marvel.
But let them think, and think again,
I feel I’m bound for heaven;
I hope I shall with Jesus reign,
I therefore still will praise Him.

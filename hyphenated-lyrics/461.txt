# JOHN 3:37

O help us, Lord! each hour of need
Thy heav’n-ly suc-cor give;
Help us in thought and word and deed
Each hour on earth we live.
O help us when our spir-its cry
With con-trite an-guish sore;
And when our hearts are cold and dry,
O help us, Lord, the more.

O help us, Lord! each hour of need
Thy heav’nly succor give;
Help us in thought and word and deed
Each hour on earth we live.
O help us when our spirits cry
With contrite anguish sore;
And when our hearts are cold and dry,
O help us, Lord, the more.

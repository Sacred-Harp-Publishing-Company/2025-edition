# BOUND FOR CANAAN

O when shall I see Je-sus,
And reign with Him a-bove?
And from the flow-ing foun-tain
Drink ev-er-last-ing love?

[chorus]
I’m on my way to Ca-naan,
To the new Je-ru-sa-lem.

When shall I be de-liv-ered
From this vain world of sin?
And with my bless-ed Je-sus
Drink end-less pleas-ures in?

But now I am a sol-dier,
My Cap-tain’s gone be-fore;
He’s giv-en me my or-ders,
And bids me not give o’er.

------

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above?
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love?

[chorus]
I’m on my way to Canaan,
To the new Jerusalem.

When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin?
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in?

But now I am a soldier,
My Captain’s gone before;
He’s given me my orders,
And bids me not give o’er.

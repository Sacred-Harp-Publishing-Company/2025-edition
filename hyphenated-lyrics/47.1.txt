Sal-va-tion, O the joy-ful sound!
’Tis pleas-ure to our ears,
A sov-’reign balm for ev-’ry wound,
A cor-dial for our fears.

Bur-ied in sor-row and in sin,
At hell’s dark door we lay,
But we a-rise by grace di-vine
To see a heav’n-ly day.

Sal-va-tion! let the ech-o fly
The spa-cious earth a-round,
While all the ar-mies of the sky
Con-spire to raise the sound.

Salvation, O the joyful sound!
’Tis pleasure to our ears,
A sov’reign balm for ev’ry wound,
A cordial for our fears.

Buried in sorrow and in sin,
At hell’s dark door we lay,
But we arise by grace divine
To see a heav’nly day.

Salvation! let the echo fly
The spacious earth around,
While all the armies of the sky
Conspire to raise the sound.

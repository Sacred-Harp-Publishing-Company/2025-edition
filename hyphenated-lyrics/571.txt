Lord, I would be as Thou art;
Give me Thine o-be-dient heart.
Thou art pit-i-ful and kind;
Let me have Thy lov-ing mind.

Let me a-bove all ful-fill
God my heav’n-ly Fa-ther’s will,
Nev-er His good Spir-it grieve,
On-ly to His glo-ry live.

Lord, I would be as Thou art;
Give me Thine obedient heart.
Thou art pitiful and kind;
Let me have Thy loving mind.

Let me above all fulfill
God my heav’nly Father’s will,
Never His good Spirit grieve,
Only to His glory live.

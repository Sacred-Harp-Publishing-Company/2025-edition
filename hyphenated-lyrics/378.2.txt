# NEVER TURN BACK

When to that bless-ed world I rise,
I’ll nev-er turn back an-y more;
And join the an-thems in the skies,
I’ll nev-er turn back an-y more.

[chorus]
An-y more, an-y more,
An-y more, my Lord:
I’ll nev-er turn back an-y more.

------

When to that blessed world I rise,
I’ll never turn back any more;
And join the anthems in the skies,
I’ll never turn back any more.

[chorus]
Any more, any more,
Any more, my Lord:
I’ll never turn back any more.

# TROUBLES OVER

Fare-well, con-flict-ing hopes and fears,
Soon my trou-bles will be o-ver.
How bright th’un-chang-ing morn ap-pears!
Soon my trou-bles will be o-ver.

[chorus]
Trou-bles o-ver,
Soon my trou-bles will be o-ver.

Fare-well, in-con-stant world, fare-well,
Soon my trou-bles will be o-ver.
Where lights and shades al-ter-nate dwell,
Soon my trou-bles will be o-ver.

------

Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears,
Soon my troubles will be over.
How bright th’unchanging morn appears!
Soon my troubles will be over.

[chorus]
Troubles over,
Soon my troubles will be over.

Farewell, inconstant world, farewell,
Soon my troubles will be over.
Where lights and shades alternate dwell,
Soon my troubles will be over.

# HEAVENLY REST

How hap-py are the souls a-bove,
From sin and sor-row free;
With Je-sus they are now at rest,
And all His glo-ry see,

[verse 1 chorus]
And all His glo-ry see,
And all His glo-ry see,
With Je-sus they are now at rest,
And all His glo-ry see.

------

How happy are the souls above,
From sin and sorrow free;
With Jesus they are now at rest,
And all His glory see,

[verse 1 chorus]
And all His glory see,
And all His glory see,
With Jesus they are now at rest,
And all His glory see.

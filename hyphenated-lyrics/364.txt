“’Tis fin-ished,” the Re-deem-er said,
And meek-ly bowed His dy-ing head.
While we the sen-tence scan,
Come, sin-ners, and ob-serve the word;
Be-hold the con-quest of the Lord,
Com-plete for sin-ful man.

“’Tis finished,” the Redeemer said,
And meekly bowed His dying head.
While we the sentence scan,
Come, sinners, and observe the word;
Behold the conquest of the Lord,
Complete for sinful man.

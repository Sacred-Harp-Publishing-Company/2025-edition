# MESSIAH

He comes, He comes! to judge the world,
A-loud th’arch-an-gel cries,
While thun-ders roll from pole to pole,
And light-nings cleave the skies.
Th’af-fright-ed na-tions hear the sound,
And up-ward lift their eyes;
The slum-b’ring ten-ants of the ground
In liv-ing ar-mies rise.

Thou aw-ful judge of quick and dead,
The watch-ful pow’r be-stow;
So shall I to my ways take heed,
To all I speak or do.
If now Thou stand-est at the door,
O let me feel Thee near;
And make my peace with God, be-fore
I at Thy bar ap-pear.

He comes, He comes! to judge the world,
Aloud th’archangel cries,
While thunders roll from pole to pole,
And lightnings cleave the skies.
Th’affrighted nations hear the sound,
And upward lift their eyes;
The slumb’ring tenants of the ground
In living armies rise.

Thou awful judge of quick and dead,
The watchful pow’r bestow;
So shall I to my ways take heed,
To all I speak or do.
If now Thou standest at the door,
O let me feel Thee near;
And make my peace with God, before
I at Thy bar appear.

# PEACE AND JOY

In the cross of Christ I glo-ry,
Tow-’ring o’er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sa-cred sto-ry
Gath-ers round its head sub-lime.
When the woes of life o’er-take me,
Hopes de-ceive and fears an-noy,
Nev-er shall the cross for-sake me;
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

When the sun of bliss is beam-ing
Light and love up-on my way,
From the cross the ra-diance stream-ing
Adds more lus-ter to the day.
Bane and bless-ing, pain and pleas-ure
By the cross are sat-is-fied;
Peace is there that knows no meas-ure,
Joys that from all time a-bide.

In the cross of Christ I glory,
Tow’ring o’er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sacred story
Gathers round its head sublime.
When the woes of life o’ertake me,
Hopes deceive and fears annoy,
Never shall the cross forsake me;
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

When the sun of bliss is beaming
Light and love upon my way,
From the cross the radiance streaming
Adds more luster to the day.
Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure
By the cross are satisfied;
Peace is there that knows no measure,
Joys that from all time abide.

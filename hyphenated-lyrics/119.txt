# HEAVEN’S MY HOME

Come, all my dear breth-ren, and help me to sing:
I’m go-ing to Je-sus, He’s heav-en’s great King;
He died to a-tone for the sins of the world;
His ban-ner is fly-ing, His sails are un-furled.

[chorus]
Heav-en’s my home, heav-en’s my home,
I’m go-ing to Je-sus, for heav-en’s my home.

While here in the val-ley of con-flict I stay,
Oh, give me sub-mis-sion, and strength as my day;
In all my af-flic-tions to Thee would I come,
Re-joic-ing in hope of my glo-ri-ous home.

I long, dear-est Lord, in Thy beau-ties to shine,
No more as an ex-ile in sor-row to pine;
And in Thy dear im-age a-rise from the tomb,
With glo-ri-fied mil-lions to praise Thee at home.

Come, all my dear brethren, and help me to sing:
I’m going to Jesus, He’s heaven’s great King;
He died to atone for the sins of the world;
His banner is flying, His sails are unfurled.

[chorus]
Heaven’s my home, heaven’s my home,
I’m going to Jesus, for heaven’s my home.

While here in the valley of conflict I stay,
Oh, give me submission, and strength as my day;
In all my afflictions to Thee would I come,
Rejoicing in hope of my glorious home.

I long, dearest Lord, in Thy beauties to shine,
No more as an exile in sorrow to pine;
And in Thy dear image arise from the tomb,
With glorified millions to praise Thee at home.

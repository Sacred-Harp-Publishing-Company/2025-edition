# JESUS IS MY FRIEND

Come life, come death, come, then, what will,
Je-sus is my friend.
His foot-steps I will fol-low still,
Je-sus is my friend.

[chorus]
Je-sus is my friend,
Oh! hal-le-lu-jah;
Je-sus is my friend.

Come life, come death, come, then, what will,
Jesus is my friend.
His footsteps I will follow still,
Jesus is my friend.

[chorus]
Jesus is my friend,
Oh! hallelujah;
Jesus is my friend.

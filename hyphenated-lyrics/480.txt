# REDEMPTION

There up-on the cross of Cal-va-ry
Our bless-ed Sav-ior died;
There be-tween two thieves our bless-ed Lord
For us was cru-ci-fied.

[chorus]
Oh, His blood was shed that we might live
With Him when life is o’er,
And up-on the clouds of glo-ry ride
Safe to that peace-ful shore.

Oh! He suf-fered there for guilt-y man,
His life so free-ly gave,
When He paid the debt we could not pay
And tri-umphed o’er the grave.

There upon the cross of Calvary
Our blessed Savior died;
There between two thieves our blessed Lord
For us was crucified.

[chorus]
Oh, His blood was shed that we might live
With Him when life is o’er,
And upon the clouds of glory ride
Safe to that peaceful shore.

Oh! He suffered there for guilty man,
His life so freely gave,
When He paid the debt we could not pay
And triumphed o’er the grave.

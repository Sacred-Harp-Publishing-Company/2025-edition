# YE HEEDLESS ONES

Ye heed-less ones who wild-ly stroll,
The grave will soon be-come your bed,
Where si-lence reigns and va-pors roll
In sol-emn dark-ness round your head.
Your friends will pass this lone-some place
And with a sigh move slow-ly on,
Still gaz-ing on the spires of grass
With which your graves are o-ver-grown.

Ye heedless ones who wildly stroll,
The grave will soon become your bed,
Where silence reigns and vapors roll
In solemn darkness round your head.
Your friends will pass this lonesome place
And with a sigh move slowly on,
Still gazing on the spires of grass
With which your graves are overgrown.

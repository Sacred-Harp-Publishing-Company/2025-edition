# SYMPHONY

Be-hold, the Judge de-scends, His guards are nigh;
Tem-pests and fire at-tend Him down the sky.
Heav’n, earth, and hell, draw near; let all things come
To hear His jus-tice and the sin-ner’s doom:
But gath-er first my saints, the Judge com-mands;
Bring them, ye an-gels, from their dis-tant lands.

Behold, the Judge descends, His guards are nigh;
Tempests and fire attend Him down the sky.
Heav’n, earth, and hell, draw near; let all things come
To hear His justice and the sinner’s doom:
But gather first my saints, the Judge commands;
Bring them, ye angels, from their distant lands.

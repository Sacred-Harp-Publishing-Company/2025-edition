# THE CHRISTIAN’S HOPE

A few more days on earth to spend,
And all my toils and cares shall end,
And I shall see my God and friend,
And praise His name on high.
No more to sigh or shed a tear,
No more to suf-fer pain or fear,
But God and Christ and heav’n ap-pear
Un-to the rap-tured eye.

Then, O my soul, de-spond no more:
The storm of life will soon be o’er,
And I shall find the peace-ful shore
Of ev-er-last-ing rest.
O hap-py day! O joy-ful hour!
When, freed from earth, my soul shall tow’r
Be-yond the reach of Sa-tan’s pow’r,
To be for-ev-er blest.

To earth-ly cares I bid fare-well,
And tri-umph o-ver death and hell,
And go where saints and an-gels dwell,
To praise th’E-ter-nal Three.
I’ll join with those who’ve gone be-fore,
Who sing and shout, their suf-f’rings o’er,
Where pain and part-ing are no more,
To all e-ter-ni-ty.

No more to sigh or shed a tear,
No more to suffer pain or fear,
But God and Christ and heav’n appear

And I shall find the peaceful shore
Of everlasting rest.
O happy day! O joyful hour!
When, freed from earth, my soul shall tow’r
Beyond the reach of Satan’s pow’r,
To be forever blest.

To earthly cares I bid farewell,
And triumph over death and hell,
And go where saints and angels dwell,
To praise th’Eternal Three.
I’ll join with those who’ve gone before,
Who sing and shout, their suff’rings o’er,
Where pain and parting are no more,
To all eternity.

“Mer-cy, O Thou Son of Da-vid!”
Thus poor blind Bar-ti-meus prayed;
“Oth-ers by Thy word are sav-ed,
Now to me af-ford Thine aid.”

Man-y for his cry-ing chid him,
But he called the loud-er still,
Till the gra-cious Sav-ior bid him,
“Come and ask me what you will.”

“Mercy, O Thou Son of David!”
Thus poor blind Bartimeus prayed;
“Others by Thy word are saved,
Now to me afford Thine aid.”

Many for his crying chid him,
But he called the louder still,
Till the gracious Savior bid him,
“Come and ask me what you will.”

# NEW AGATITE

All hail the pow’r of Je-sus’ name,
Let an-gels pros-trate fall;

[chorus]
Bring forth the roy-al di-a-dem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

His mer-cy and His right-eous-ness
Let heav’n and earth pro-claim;

------

All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name,
Let angels prostrate fall;

[chorus]
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

His mercy and His righteousness
Let heav’n and earth proclaim;

# THE PRODIGAL SON

Af-flic-tions, though they seem se-vere,
Are oft in mer-cy sent:
They stopped the pro-di-gal’s ca-reer
And caused him to re-pent.

[chorus]
Oh! I die with hun-ger here, he cries,
Oh! I die with hun-ger here, he cries,
And starve in a for-eign land;
My fa-ther’s house hath large sup-plies,
And boun-teous are his hands.

Al-though he no re-lent-ing felt
Till he had spent his store,
His stub-born heart be-gan to melt
When fam-ine pinched him sore.

What have I gained by sin, he said,
But hun-ger, shame, and fear?
My fa-ther’s house a-bounds with bread
While I am starv-ing here.

I’ll go and tell him what I’ve done,
Fall down be-fore his face;
Not wor-thy to be called his son,
I’ll ask a ser-vant’s place.

He saw his son re-turn-ing back,
He looked, he ran, he smiled,
And threw his arms a-round the neck
Of his re-bel-lious child.

------

Afflictions, though they seem severe,
Are oft in mercy sent:
They stopped the prodigal’s career
And caused him to repent.

[chorus]
Oh! I die with hunger here, he cries,
Oh! I die with hunger here, he cries,
And starve in a foreign land;
My father’s house hath large supplies,
And bounteous are his hands.

Although he no relenting felt
Till he had spent his store,
His stubborn heart began to melt
When famine pinched him sore.

What have I gained by sin, he said,
But hunger, shame, and fear?
My father’s house abounds with bread
While I am starving here.

I’ll go and tell him what I’ve done,
Fall down before his face;
Not worthy to be called his son,
I’ll ask a servant’s place.

He saw his son returning back,
He looked, he ran, he smiled,
And threw his arms around the neck
Of his rebellious child.

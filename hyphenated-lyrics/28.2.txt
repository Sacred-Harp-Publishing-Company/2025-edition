Life is the time to serve the Lord,
The time t’in-sure the great re-ward;
And while the lamp holds out to burn,
The vil-est sin-ner may re-turn.

Life is the hour that God has giv’n
To es-cape hell and fly to heav’n;
The day of grace, and mor-tals may
Se-cure the bless-ing of the day.

The liv-ing know that they must die,
But all the dead for-got-ten lie;
Their mem-’ry and their sense is gone,
A-like un-know-ing and un-known.

Life is the time to serve the Lord,
The time t’insure the great reward;
And while the lamp holds out to burn,
The vilest sinner may return.

Life is the hour that God has giv’n
To escape hell and fly to heav’n;
The day of grace, and mortals may
Secure the blessing of the day.

The living know that they must die,
But all the dead forgotten lie;
Their mem’ry and their sense is gone,
Alike unknowing and unknown.

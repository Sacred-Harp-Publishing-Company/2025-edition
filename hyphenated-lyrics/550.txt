# BLISSFUL DAWNING

My God, the spring of all my joys,
The life of my de-lights,
The glo-ry of my bright-est days,
And com-fort of my nights!
In dark-est shades if Thou ap-pear,
My bliss-ful dawn-ing is be-gun:
Thou art my soul’s bright morn-ing star,
And Thou my ris-ing sun.

My God, the spring of all my joys,
The life of my delights,
The glory of my brightest days,
And comfort of my nights!
In darkest shades if Thou appear,
My blissful dawning is begun:
Thou art my soul’s bright morning star,
And Thou my rising sun.

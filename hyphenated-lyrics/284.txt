# GARDEN HYMN

The Lord in-to His gar-den comes,
The spic-es yield a rich per-fume,
The lil-ies grow and thrive;
Re-fresh-ing show’rs of grace di-vine
From Je-sus flow to ev-’ry vine,
And make the dead re-vive.

Come, breth-ren, you who love the Lord,
Who taste the sweet-ness of His word,
In Je-sus’ ways go on;
Our trou-bles and our tri-als here
Will on-ly make us rich-er there,
When we ar-rive at home.

The Lord into His garden comes,
The spices yield a rich perfume,
The lilies grow and thrive;
Refreshing show’rs of grace divine
From Jesus flow to ev’ry vine,
And make the dead revive.

Come, brethren, you who love the Lord,
Who taste the sweetness of His word,
In Jesus’ ways go on;
Our troubles and our trials here
Will only make us richer there,
When we arrive at home.

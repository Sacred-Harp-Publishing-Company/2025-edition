# ECSTASY

O when shall I see Je-sus,
And reign with Him a-bove?
And from the flow-ing foun-tain
Drink ev-er-last-ing love?

[chorus]
O had I wings, I would fly a-way and be at rest,
And I’d praise God in His bright a-bode.

When-e’er you meet with trou-bles
And tri-als on your way,
Then cast your care on Je-sus,
And don’t for-get to pray.

Gird on the gos-pel ar-mor
Of faith and hope and love,
And when the com-bat’s end-ed,
He’ll car-ry you a-bove.

O do not be dis-cour-aged,
For Je-sus is your Friend;
And if you lack for knowl-edge,
He’ll not re-fuse to lend.

Nei-ther will He up-braid you,
Though of-ten you re-quest;
He’ll give you grace to con-quer,
And take you home to rest.

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above?
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love?

[chorus]
O had I wings, I would fly away and be at rest,
And I’d praise God in His bright abode.

Whene’er you meet with troubles
And trials on your way,
Then cast your care on Jesus,
And don’t forget to pray.

Gird on the gospel armor
Of faith and hope and love,
And when the combat’s ended,
He’ll carry you above.

O do not be discouraged,
For Jesus is your Friend;
And if you lack for knowledge,
He’ll not refuse to lend.

Neither will He upbraid you,
Though often you request;
He’ll give you grace to conquer,
And take you home to rest.

# HEAVENLY MEETING

The day is past and gone,
The eve-ning shades ap-pear;
O may we all re-mem-ber well
The night of death is near.

[chorus]
O may we meet in heav’n;
In heav-en a-lone no sor-row’s found,
And there’s no part-ing there.

------

The day is past and gone,
The evening shades appear;
O may we all remember well
The night of death is near.

[chorus]
O may we meet in heav’n;
In heaven alone no sorrow’s found,
And there’s no parting there.

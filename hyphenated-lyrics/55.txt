# CONVERSE

I’m tired of vis-its, modes and forms,
And flat-t’ries paid to fel-low worms;
Their con-ver-sa-tion cloys,
Their vain a-mours and emp-ty stuff,
But I can ne’er en-joy e-nough
Of Thy best com-pa-ny, my Lord,
Thou life of all my joys.

I’m tired of visits, modes and forms,
And flatt’ries paid to fellow worms;
Their conversation cloys,
Their vain amours and empty stuff,
But I can ne’er enjoy enough
Of Thy best company, my Lord,
Thou life of all my joys.

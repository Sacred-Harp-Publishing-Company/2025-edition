Ap-proach, my soul, the mer-cy seat,
Where Je-sus an-swers prayer;
There hum-bly fall be-fore His feet,
For none can per-ish there.

Thy prom-ise is my on-ly plea,
With this I ven-ture nigh;
Thou call-est bur-dened souls to Thee,
And such, O Lord, am I.

Oh, won-drous love! to bleed and die,
To bear the cross and shame,
That guilt-y sin-ners, such as I,
Might plead Thy gra-cious name.

Approach, my soul, the mercy seat,
Where Jesus answers prayer;
There humbly fall before His feet,
For none can perish there.

Thy promise is my only plea,
With this I venture nigh;
Thou callest burdened souls to Thee,
And such, O Lord, am I.

Oh, wondrous love! to bleed and die,
To bear the cross and shame,
That guilty sinners, such as I,
Might plead Thy gracious name.

# EASTER ANTHEM

The Lord is ris’n in-deed!
Hal-le-lu-jah!

Now is Christ ris-en from the dead, and be-come the first-fruits of them that slept.
Hal-le-lu-jah, hal-le-lu-jah, hal-le-lu-jah!

And did He rise?
Did He rise?
Hear it, ye na-tions!
Hear it, O ye dead!
He rose,
He burst the bars of death,
And tri-umphed o’er the grave.

Then, then I rose;
Then first hu-man-i-ty tri-um-phant passed the crys-tal ports of light, and seized e-ter-nal youth.

Man, all im-mor-tal, hail; hail, Heav-en, all lav-ish of strange gifts to man:
Thine’s all the glo-ry, man’s the bound-less bliss;
Thine’s all the glo-ry, man’s the bound-less bliss.

------

The Lord is ris’n indeed!
Hallelujah!

Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

And did He rise?
Did He rise?
Hear it, ye nations!
Hear it, O ye dead!
He rose,
He burst the bars of death,
And triumphed o’er the grave.

Then, then I rose;
Then first humanity triumphant passed the crystal ports of light, and seized eternal youth.

Man, all immortal, hail; hail, Heaven, all lavish of strange gifts to man:
Thine’s all the glory, man’s the boundless bliss;
Thine’s all the glory, man’s the boundless bliss.

God, my sup-port-er and my hope,
My help for-ev-er near,
Thine arm of mer-cy held me up
When sink-ing in de-spair.

But to draw near to Thee, my God,
Shall be my sweet em-ploy;
My tongue shall sound Thy works a-broad
And tell the world my joy.

God, my supporter and my hope,
My help forever near,
Thine arm of mercy held me up
When sinking in despair.

But to draw near to Thee, my God,
Shall be my sweet employ;
My tongue shall sound Thy works abroad
And tell the world my joy.

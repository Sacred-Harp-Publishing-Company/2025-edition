# THE CONVERTED THIEF

As on the cross the Sav-ior hung,
And wept, and bled, and died,
He poured sal-va-tion on a wretch
That lan-guished at His side.
His crimes, with in-ward grief and shame,
The pen-i-tent con-fessed,
Then turned his dy-ing eyes to Christ,
And thus his prayer ad-dressed.

Je-sus, Thou Son and heir of heav’n,
Thou spot-less Lamb of God!
I see Thee bathed in sweat and tears,
And wel-t’ring in Thy blood.
Yet quick-ly from these scenes of woe
In tri-umph Thou shalt rise,
Burst through the gloom-y shades of death,
And shine a-bove the skies.

A-mid the glo-ries of that world,
Dear Sav-ior, think on me,
And in the vic-t’ries of Thy death
Let me a shar-er be.
His prayer the dy-ing Je-sus hears,
And in-stant-ly re-plies:
To-day thy part-ing soul shall be
With me in par-a-dise.

As on the cross the Savior hung,
And wept, and bled, and died,
He poured salvation on a wretch
That languished at His side.
His crimes, with inward grief and shame,
The penitent confessed,
Then turned his dying eyes to Christ,
And thus his prayer addressed.

Jesus, Thou Son and heir of heav’n,
Thou spotless Lamb of God!
I see Thee bathed in sweat and tears,
And welt’ring in Thy blood.
Yet quickly from these scenes of woe
In triumph Thou shalt rise,
Burst through the gloomy shades of death,
And shine above the skies.

Amid the glories of that world,
Dear Savior, think on me,
And in the vict’ries of Thy death
Let me a sharer be.
His prayer the dying Jesus hears,
And instantly replies:
Today thy parting soul shall be
With me in paradise.

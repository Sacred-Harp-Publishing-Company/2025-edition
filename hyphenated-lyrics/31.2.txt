Come, we who love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet ac-cord,
And thus sur-round the throne.

Let those re-fuse to sing
Who nev-er knew our God,
But ser-vants of the heav’n-ly King
May speak their joys a-broad.

The God that rules on high,
That all the earth sur-veys,
That rides up-on the storm-y sky
And calms the roar-ing seas.

Come, we who love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God,
But servants of the heav’nly King
May speak their joys abroad.

The God that rules on high,
That all the earth surveys,
That rides upon the stormy sky
And calms the roaring seas.

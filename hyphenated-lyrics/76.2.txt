# DESIRE FOR PIETY

’Tis my de-sire with God to walk,
Till the war-fare is o-ver, hal-le-lu-jah,
And with His chil-dren pray and talk,
Till the war-fare is o-ver, hal-le-lu-jah.

[chorus]
Cry A-men, pray on till the war-fare is o-ver, hal-le-lu-jah.

------

’Tis my desire with God to walk,
Till the warfare is over, hallelujah,
And with His children pray and talk,
Till the warfare is over, hallelujah.

[chorus]
Cry Amen, pray on till the warfare is over, hallelujah.

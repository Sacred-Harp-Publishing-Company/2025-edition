# HEAVENLY PORT

On Jor-dan’s storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a wish-ful eye
To Ca-naan’s fair and hap-py land
Where my pos-ses-sions lie.

[chorus]
We’ll stem the storm, it won’t be long,
The heav’n-ly port is nigh;
We’ll stem the storm, it won’t be long,
We’ll an-chor by and by.

When shall I reach that hap-py place
And be for-ev-er blest?
When shall I see my Fa-ther’s face,
And in His bos-om rest?

------

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.

[chorus]
We’ll stem the storm, it won’t be long,
The heav’nly port is nigh;
We’ll stem the storm, it won’t be long,
We’ll anchor by and by.

When shall I reach that happy place
And be forever blest?
When shall I see my Father’s face,
And in His bosom rest?

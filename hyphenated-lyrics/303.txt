# HEAVENLY LAND

There is a land of pure de-light
Where saints im-mor-tal reign;
In-fi-nite day ex-cludes the night,
And pleas-ures ban-ish pain.

There ev-er-last-ing spring a-bides,
And nev-er-with-’ring flow’rs;
Death like a nar-row sea di-vides
This heav’n-ly land from ours.

There is a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.

There everlasting spring abides,
And never-with’ring flow’rs;
Death like a narrow sea divides
This heav’nly land from ours.

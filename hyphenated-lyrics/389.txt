# FREDERICKSBURG

I need God’s bless-ings while I live,
And His un-dy-ing love;
And then I want to sing His praise
In that sweet home a-bove.
In that sweet home a-bove,
In that sweet home a-bove,
And then I want to sing His praise
In that sweet home a-bove.

------

I need God’s blessings while I live,
And His undying love;
And then I want to sing His praise
In that sweet home above.
In that sweet home above,
In that sweet home above,
And then I want to sing His praise
In that sweet home above.

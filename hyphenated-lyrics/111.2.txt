# TO DIE NO MORE

Why should we start and fear to die?
What tim-’rous worms we mor-tals are!
Death is the gate of end-less joy,
And yet we dread to en-ter there.

[chorus]
I’m go-ing home to Christ a-bove;
I’m go-ing to the Chris-tian’s rest,
To die no more, to die no more,
I’m go-ing home to die no more.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fear-less through death’s i-ron gate,
Nor feel the ter-rors as she passed.

Why should we start and fear to die?
What tim’rous worms we mortals are!
Death is the gate of endless joy,
And yet we dread to enter there.

[chorus]
I’m going home to Christ above;
I’m going to the Christian’s rest,
To die no more, to die no more,
I’m going home to die no more.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fearless through death’s iron gate,
Nor feel the terrors as she passed.

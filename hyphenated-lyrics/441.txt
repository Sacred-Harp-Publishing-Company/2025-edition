# RAYMOND

Hark, the glad sound! the Sav-ior comes,
The Sav-ior prom-ised long;
Let ev-’ry heart pre-pare a throne,
And ev-’ry voice a song.

He comes, the pris-’ner to re-lease,
In Sa-tan’s bond-age held;
The gates of brass be-fore Him burst,
The i-ron fet-ters yield.

Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes,
The Savior promised long;
Let ev’ry heart prepare a throne,
And ev’ry voice a song.

He comes, the pris’ner to release,
In Satan’s bondage held;
The gates of brass before Him burst,
The iron fetters yield.

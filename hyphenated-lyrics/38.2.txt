# WINDHAM

Broad is the road that leads to death,
And thou-sands walk to-geth-er there;
But wis-dom shows a nar-row path,
With here and there a trav-el-er.

“De-ny thy-self and take thy cross,”
Is the Re-deem-er’s great com-mand;
Na-ture must count her gold but dross,
If she would gain this heav’n-ly land.

The fear-ful soul that tires and faints,
And walks the ways of God no more,
Is but es-teemed al-most a saint,
And makes his own de-struc-tion sure.

Lord, let not all my hopes be vain,
Cre-ate my heart en-tire-ly new,
Which hyp-o-crites could ne’er at-tain,
Which false a-pos-tates nev-er knew.

Broad is the road that leads to death,
And thousands walk together there;
But wisdom shows a narrow path,
With here and there a traveler.

“Deny thyself and take thy cross,”
Is the Redeemer’s great command;
Nature must count her gold but dross,
If she would gain this heav’nly land.

The fearful soul that tires and faints,
And walks the ways of God no more,
Is but esteemed almost a saint,
And makes his own destruction sure.

Lord, let not all my hopes be vain,
Create my heart entirely new,
Which hypocrites could ne’er attain,
Which false apostates never knew.

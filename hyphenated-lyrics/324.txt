Je-sus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah;
He whom I fix my hopes up-on,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

[chorus]
I want a seat in par-a-dise,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
I love that un-ion nev-er dies,
Glo-ry! hal-le-lu-jah!

His track I see and I’ll pur-sue,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah;
The nar-row way till Him I view,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

Lo! glad I come; and Thou, dear Lamb,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah;
Shalt take me to Thee as I am,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

Jesus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
Glory, hallelujah;
He whom I fix my hopes upon,
Glory, hallelujah!

[chorus]
I want a seat in paradise,
Glory, hallelujah!
I love that union never dies,
Glory! hallelujah!

His track I see and I’ll pursue,
Glory, hallelujah;
The narrow way till Him I view,
Glory, hallelujah!

Lo! glad I come; and Thou, dear Lamb,
Glory, hallelujah;
Shalt take me to Thee as I am,
Glory, hallelujah!

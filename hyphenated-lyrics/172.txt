# HARMONY

Wake, all ye soar-ing throngs, and sing;
Ye cheer-ful war-blers of the spring,
Har-mo-nious an-thems raise,
To Him who shaped your fin-er mold,
Who tipped your glit-t’ring wings with gold,
And tuned your voice to praise.

Wake, all ye soaring throngs, and sing;
Ye cheerful warblers of the spring,
Harmonious anthems raise,
To Him who shaped your finer mold,
Who tipped your glitt’ring wings with gold,
And tuned your voice to praise.

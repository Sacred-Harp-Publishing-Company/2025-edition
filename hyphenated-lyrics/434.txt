Great God, let all my tune-ful pow’rs
A-wake, and sing Thy might-y name;
Thy hand re-volves my cir-cling hours,
Thy hand from whence my be-ing came.
Thus will I sing till na-ture cease,
Till sense and lan-guage are no more,
And af-ter death Thy bound-less grace
Through ev-er-last-ing years a-dore.

Great God, let all my tuneful pow’rs
Awake, and sing Thy mighty name;
Thy hand revolves my circling hours,
Thy hand from whence my being came.
Thus will I sing till nature cease,
Till sense and language are no more,
And after death Thy boundless grace
Through everlasting years adore.

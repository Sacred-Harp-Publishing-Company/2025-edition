How charm-ing is the place
Where my Re-deem-er God
Un-veils the beau-ties of His face
And sheds His love a-broad.
Give me, O Lord, a place
With-in Thy blest a-bode,
A-mong the chil-dren of Thy grace,
The ser-vants of my God.

How charming is the place
Where my Redeemer God
Unveils the beauties of His face
And sheds His love abroad.
Give me, O Lord, a place
Within Thy blest abode,
Among the children of Thy grace,
The servants of my God.

# GODâ€™S HELPING HAND

Lord, let Thy good-ness lead our land,
Still saved by Thy al-might-y hand,
The trib-ute of its love to bring
To Thee, our Sav-ior and our King.

Thy wea-ry chil-dren need Thee still,
Our souls each day with grace to fill;
Be Thou our com-fort and our friend,
And lead us safe-ly to the end.

Still saved by Thy almighty hand,
The tribute of its love to bring

Thy weary children need Thee still,
Our souls each day with grace to fill;

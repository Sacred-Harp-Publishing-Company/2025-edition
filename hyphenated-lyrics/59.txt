# HOLY MANNA

Breth-ren, we have met to wor-ship,
And a-dore the Lord our God;
Will you pray with all your pow-er
While we try to preach the word?
All is vain un-less the Spir-it
Of the Ho-ly One comes down;
Breth-ren, pray, and ho-ly man-na
Will be show-ered all a-round.

Breth-ren, see poor sin-ners round you,
Trem-bling on the brink of woe;
Death is com-ing, hell is mov-ing,
Can you bear to let them go?
See our fa-thers, see our moth-ers,
And our chil-dren sink-ing down;
Breth-ren, pray, and ho-ly man-na
Will be show-ered all a-round.

Sis-ters, will you join and help us?
Mo-ses’ sis-ters aid-ed him;
Will you help the trem-bling mourn-ers,
Who are strug-gling hard with sin?
Tell them all a-bout the Sav-ior,
Tell them that He will be found;
Sis-ters, pray, and ho-ly man-na
Will be show-ered all a-round.

Is there here a trem-bling jail-er,
Seek-ing grace, and filled with fears?
Is there here a weep-ing Ma-ry,
Pour-ing forth a flood of tears?
Breth-ren, join your cries to help them;
Sis-ters, let your prayers a-bound;
Pray, O pray that ho-ly man-na
May be scat-tered all a-round.

Let us love our God su-preme-ly,
Let us love each oth-er, too;
Let us love and pray for sin-ners,
Till our God makes all things new.
Then He’ll call us home to heav-en,
At His ta-ble we’ll sit down;
Christ will gird Him-self, and serve us
With sweet man-na all a-round.

Brethren, we have met to worship,
And adore the Lord our God;
Will you pray with all your power
While we try to preach the word?
All is vain unless the Spirit
Of the Holy One comes down;
Brethren, pray, and holy manna
Will be showered all around.

Brethren, see poor sinners round you,
Trembling on the brink of woe;
Death is coming, hell is moving,
Can you bear to let them go?
See our fathers, see our mothers,
And our children sinking down;
Brethren, pray, and holy manna
Will be showered all around.

Sisters, will you join and help us?
Moses’ sisters aided him;
Will you help the trembling mourners,
Who are struggling hard with sin?
Tell them all about the Savior,
Tell them that He will be found;
Sisters, pray, and holy manna
Will be showered all around.

Is there here a trembling jailer,
Seeking grace, and filled with fears?
Is there here a weeping Mary,
Pouring forth a flood of tears?
Brethren, join your cries to help them;
Sisters, let your prayers abound;
Pray, O pray that holy manna
May be scattered all around.

Let us love our God supremely,
Let us love each other, too;
Let us love and pray for sinners,
Till our God makes all things new.
Then He’ll call us home to heaven,
At His table we’ll sit down;
Christ will gird Himself, and serve us
With sweet manna all around.

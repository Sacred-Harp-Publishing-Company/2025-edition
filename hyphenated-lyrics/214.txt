# REPENTANCE

Oh, if my soul was formed for woe,
How would I vent my sighs!
Re-pen-tance should like riv-ers flow
From both my stream-ing eyes.
’Twas for my sins my dear-est Lord
Hung on that curs-ed tree,
And groaned a-way His dy-ing life
For thee, my soul, for thee.

Oh, if my soul was formed for woe,
How would I vent my sighs!
Repentance should like rivers flow
From both my streaming eyes.
’Twas for my sins my dearest Lord
Hung on that cursed tree,
And groaned away His dying life
For thee, my soul, for thee.

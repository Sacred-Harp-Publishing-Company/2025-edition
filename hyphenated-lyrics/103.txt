And let this fee-ble bod-y fail,
And let it faint or die;
My soul shall quit this mourn-ful vale,
And soar to worlds on high.

[verse 1 chorus]
And soar to worlds on high,
And soar to worlds on high,
My soul shall quit this mourn-ful vale,
And soar to worlds on high.

Shall join the dis-em-bod-ied saints
And find its long-sought rest,
The on-ly bliss for which it pants,
In my Re-deem-er’s breast.

[verse 2 chorus]
In my Re-deem-er’s breast,
In my Re-deem-er’s breast,
The on-ly bliss for which it pants,
In my Re-deem-er’s breast.

O what are all my suf-f’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that en-rap-tured host t’ap-pear,
And wor-ship at Thy feet!

[verse 3 chorus]
And wor-ship at Thy feet,
And wor-ship at Thy feet,
With that en-rap-tured host t’ap-pear,
And wor-ship at Thy feet!

And let this feeble body fail,
And let it faint or die;
My soul shall quit this mournful vale,
And soar to worlds on high.

[verse 1 chorus]
And soar to worlds on high,
And soar to worlds on high,
My soul shall quit this mournful vale,
And soar to worlds on high.

Shall join the disembodied saints
And find its long-sought rest,
The only bliss for which it pants,
In my Redeemer’s breast.

[verse 2 chorus]
In my Redeemer’s breast,
In my Redeemer’s breast,
The only bliss for which it pants,
In my Redeemer’s breast.

O what are all my suff’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that enraptured host t’appear,
And worship at Thy feet!

[verse 3 chorus]
And worship at Thy feet,
And worship at Thy feet,
With that enraptured host t’appear,
And worship at Thy feet!

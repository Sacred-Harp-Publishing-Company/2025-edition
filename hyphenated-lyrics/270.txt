# CONFIDENCE

A-way, my un-be-liev-ing fear;
Fear shall in me no more have place;
My Sav-ior doth not yet ap-pear;
He hides the bright-ness of His face;
But shall I there-fore let Him go,
And base-ly to the tempt-er yield?
No, in the strength of Je-sus, no!
I nev-er will give up my shield.

Away, my unbelieving fear;
Fear shall in me no more have place;
My Savior doth not yet appear;
He hides the brightness of His face;
But shall I therefore let Him go,
And basely to the tempter yield?
No, in the strength of Jesus, no!
I never will give up my shield.

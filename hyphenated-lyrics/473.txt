Re-joice! the Lord is King:
Your Lord and King a-dore;
Mor-tals, give thanks and sing,
And tri-umph ev-er-more:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
Re-joice, a-gain I say, re-joice!
Re-joice, a-gain I say, re-joice!

Re-joice in glo-rious hope!
Je-sus the Judge shall come
And take His ser-vants up
To their e-ter-nal home:
We soon shall hear the an-gel’s voice,
The trump of God shall sound: Re-joice!
The trump of God shall sound: Re-joice!

Rejoice! the Lord is King:
Your Lord and King adore;
Mortals, give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

Rejoice in glorious hope!
Jesus the Judge shall come
And take His servants up
To their eternal home:
We soon shall hear the angel’s voice,
The trump of God shall sound: Rejoice!
The trump of God shall sound: Rejoice!

O for a thou-sand tongues to sing
My great Re-deem-er’s praise,
The glo-ries of my God and King,
The tri-umphs of His grace!

My gra-cious Mas-ter and my God,
As-sist me to pro-claim,
To spread through all the earth a-broad
The hon-ors of Thy name.

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name.

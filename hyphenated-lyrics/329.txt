# VAIN WORLD ADIEU

When for e-ter-nal worlds we steer,
And seas are calm and skies are clear,
And faith in live-ly ex-er-cise,
And dis-tant hills of Ca-naan rise,
The soul for joy then claps her wings,
And loud her hal-le-lu-jah sings,
Vain world, a-dieu,
And loud her hal-le-lu-jah sings,
Vain world, a-dieu.

With cheer-ful hope her eyes ex-plore
Each land-mark on the dis-tant shore:
The trees of life, the pas-tures green,
The crys-tal stream—de-light-ful scene.
A-gain for joy she claps her wings,
And loud her hal-le-lu-jah sings,
Vain world, a-dieu,
And loud her love-ly son-net sings,
Vain world, a-dieu.

The near-er still she draws to land,
More ea-ger all her pow’rs ex-pand;
With stead-y helm, and free-bent sail,
Her an-chor drops with-in the veil.
A-gain for joy she claps her wings,
And her ce-les-tial son-net sings,
I’m there at last,
And her ce-les-tial son-net sings,
I’m there at last.

When for eternal worlds we steer,
And seas are calm and skies are clear,
And faith in lively exercise,
And distant hills of Canaan rise,
The soul for joy then claps her wings,
And loud her hallelujah sings,
Vain world, adieu,
And loud her hallelujah sings,
Vain world, adieu.

With cheerful hope her eyes explore
Each landmark on the distant shore:
The trees of life, the pastures green,
The crystal stream—delightful scene.
Again for joy she claps her wings,
And loud her hallelujah sings,
Vain world, adieu,
And loud her lovely sonnet sings,
Vain world, adieu.

The nearer still she draws to land,
More eager all her pow’rs expand;
With steady helm, and free-bent sail,
Her anchor drops within the veil.
Again for joy she claps her wings,
And her celestial sonnet sings,
I’m there at last,
And her celestial sonnet sings,
I’m there at last.

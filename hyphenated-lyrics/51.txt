# STAR IN THE EAST

Hail the blest morn, when the great Me-di-a-tor
Down from the re-gions of glo-ry de-scends;
Shep-herds, go wor-ship the babe in the man-ger,
Lo! for His guard the bright an-gels at-tend.

Cold on His cra-dle the dew-drops are shin-ing,
Low lies His bed with the beasts of the stall;
An-gels a-dore Him in slum-ber re-clin-ing,
Mak-er, and Mon-arch, and Sav-ior of all.

Say, shall we yield Him, in cost-ly de-vo-tion,
O-dors of E-dom and of-f’rings di-vine,
Gems of the moun-tain and pearls of the o-cean,
Myrrh from the for-est and gold from the mine?

Vain-ly we of-fer each am-ple ob-la-tion,
Vain-ly with gold would His fa-vor se-cure;
Rich-er by far is the heart’s ad-o-ra-tion,
Dear-er to God are the prayers of the poor.

Bright-est and best of the sons of the morn-ing,
Dawn on our dark-ness and lend us thine aid;
Star of the east, the ho-ri-zon a-dorn-ing,
Guide where our in-fant Re-deem-er is laid.

Hail the blest morn, when the great Mediator
Down from the regions of glory descends;
Shepherds, go worship the babe in the manger,
Lo! for His guard the bright angels attend.

Cold on His cradle the dewdrops are shining,
Low lies His bed with the beasts of the stall;
Angels adore Him in slumber reclining,
Maker, and Monarch, and Savior of all.

Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion,
Odors of Edom and off’rings divine,
Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean,
Myrrh from the forest and gold from the mine?

Vainly we offer each ample oblation,
Vainly with gold would His favor secure;
Richer by far is the heart’s adoration,
Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid;
Star of the east, the horizon adorning,
Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.

# PROSPERITY

O may I wor-thy prove to see,
Glo-ry to Im-man-u-el!
The saints in full pros-per-i-ty,
Glo-ry to Im-man-u-el!
To see the bride, the glit-t’ring bride,
Glo-ry to Im-man-u-el!
Close seat-ed by her Sav-ior’s side,
Glo-ry to Im-man-u-el!

O may I worthy prove to see,
Glory to Immanuel!
The saints in full prosperity,
Glory to Immanuel!
To see the bride, the glitt’ring bride,
Glory to Immanuel!
Close seated by her Savior’s side,
Glory to Immanuel!

# THE ARK

When No-ah with his fa-vored few
Was or-dered to em-bark,
Eight hu-man souls, a lit-tle crew,
En-tered on board his ark.

[chorus]
Je-ho-vah shut them in,
The wa-ters rage, the bil-lows roar;
The Lord has shut them in,
The wa-ters rage, the bil-lows roar;
Je-ho-vah shut them in.

------

When Noah with his favored few
Was ordered to embark,
Eight human souls, a little crew,
Entered on board his ark.

[chorus]
Jehovah shut them in,
The waters rage, the billows roar;
The Lord has shut them in,
The waters rage, the billows roar;
Jehovah shut them in.

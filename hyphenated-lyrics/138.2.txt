# OGLETREE

Fre-quent the day of God re-turns
To shed its quick-’ning beams;
And yet how slow de-vo-tion burns,
How lan-guid are its flames.

In-crease, O Lord, our faith and hope,
And fit us to as-cend
Where the as-sem-bly ne’er breaks up,
And sab-baths nev-er end.

There shall we join, and nev-er tire,
To sing im-mor-tal lays,
And, with the bright se-raph-ic choir,
Sound forth Im-man-uel’s praise.

Frequent the day of God returns
To shed its quick’ning beams;
And yet how slow devotion burns,
How languid are its flames.

Increase, O Lord, our faith and hope,
And fit us to ascend
Where the assembly ne’er breaks up,
And sabbaths never end.

There shall we join, and never tire,
To sing immortal lays,
And, with the bright seraphic choir,
Sound forth Immanuel’s praise.

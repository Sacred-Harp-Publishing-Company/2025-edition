# SAVE, LORD, OR WE PERISH

When through the torn sail the wild tem-pest is stream-ing,
When o’er the dark wave the red light-ning is gleam-ing,
Nor hope lends a ray the poor sea-man to cher-ish,
We fly to our Mak-er, Save, Lord, or we per-ish.

When through the torn sail the wild tempest is streaming,
When o’er the dark wave the red lightning is gleaming,
Nor hope lends a ray the poor seaman to cherish,
We fly to our Maker, Save, Lord, or we perish.

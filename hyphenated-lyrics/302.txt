# LOGAN

The day is past and gone,
The eve-ning shades ap-pear;
O may we all re-mem-ber well
The night of death draws near.

[chorus]
And when our days are past
And we from time re-move,
O may we in Thy bos-om rest,
The bos-om of Thy love;
So death will soon dis-robe us all
Of what we here pos-sess.

Lord, keep us safe this night,
Se-cure from all our fears;
May an-gels guard us while we sleep,
Till morn-ing light ap-pears.

The day is past and gone,
The evening shades appear;
O may we all remember well
The night of death draws near.

[chorus]
And when our days are past
And we from time remove,
O may we in Thy bosom rest,
The bosom of Thy love;
So death will soon disrobe us all
Of what we here possess.

Lord, keep us safe this night,
Secure from all our fears;
May angels guard us while we sleep,
Till morning light appears.

# FLORENCE

Not man-y years their rounds shall roll,
Each mo-ment brings it nigh,
Ere all its glo-ries stand re-vealed
To our ad-mir-ing eye.
Ye wheels of na-ture, speed your course,
Ye mor-tal pow’rs, de-cay;
Fast as ye bring the night of death,
Ye bring e-ter-nal day.

Ye wea-ry, heav-y-lad-en souls,
Who are op-pres-sed sore,
Ye trav-’lers through the wil-der-ness
To Ca-naan’s peace-ful shore,
Through chill-ing winds and beat-ing rains,
The wa-ters deep and cold,
And en-e-mies sur-round-ing you,
Take cour-age and be bold.

Though storms and hur-ri-canes a-rise,
The des-ert all a-round,
And fier-y ser-pents oft ap-pear
Through the en-chant-ed ground,
Dark nights and clouds and gloom-y fear,
And drag-ons of-ten roar,
But while the gos-pel trump we hear,
We’ll press for Ca-naan’s shore.

Not many years their rounds shall roll,
Each moment brings it nigh,
Ere all its glories stand revealed
To our admiring eye.
Ye wheels of nature, speed your course,
Ye mortal pow’rs, decay;
Fast as ye bring the night of death,
Ye bring eternal day.

Ye weary, heavy-laden souls,
Who are oppressed sore,
Ye trav’lers through the wilderness
To Canaan’s peaceful shore,
Through chilling winds and beating rains,
The waters deep and cold,
And enemies surrounding you,
Take courage and be bold.

Though storms and hurricanes arise,
The desert all around,
And fiery serpents oft appear
Through the enchanted ground,
Dark nights and clouds and gloomy fear,
And dragons often roar,
But while the gospel trump we hear,
We’ll press for Canaan’s shore.

How long, Thou faith-ful God, shall I
Here in Thy ways for-got-ten lie?
When shall the means of heal-ing be
The chan-nels of Thy grace to me?

Sin-ners on ev-’ry side step in,
And wash a-way their pain and sin;
But I, a help-less sin-sick soul,
Still lie ex-pir-ing at the pool.

Thou seest me ly-ing at the pool;
I would, Thou know’st, I would be whole;
O let the trou-bled wa-ters move,
And min-is-ter Thy heal-ing love.

How long, Thou faithful God, shall I
Here in Thy ways forgotten lie?
When shall the means of healing be
The channels of Thy grace to me?

Sinners on ev’ry side step in,
And wash away their pain and sin;
But I, a helpless sin-sick soul,
Still lie expiring at the pool.

Thou seest me lying at the pool;
I would, Thou know’st, I would be whole;
O let the troubled waters move,
And minister Thy healing love.

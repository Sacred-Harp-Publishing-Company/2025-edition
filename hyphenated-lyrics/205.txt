# PLEASANT HILL

Re-li-gion is the chief con-cern
Of mor-tals here be-low.
May I its great im-por-tance learn,
Its sov-’reign vir-tues know.
More need-ful this than glit-t’ring wealth
Or aught the world be-stows;
Nor rep-u-ta-tion, food, or health
Can give us such re-pose.

Re-li-gion should our thoughts en-gage
A-midst our youth-ful bloom;
’Twill fit us for de-clin-ing age
And for the aw-ful tomb.
O may my heart, by grace re-newed,
Be my Re-deem-er’s throne;
And be my stub-born will sub-dued,
His gov-ern-ment to own.

Let deep re-pen-tance, faith, and love,
Be joined with god-ly fear;
And all my con-ver-sa-tion prove
My heart to be sin-cere.
Pre-serve me from the snares of sin
Through my re-main-ing days,
And in me let each vir-tue shine,
To my Re-deem-er’s praise.

Religion is the chief concern
Of mortals here below.
May I its great importance learn,
Its sov’reign virtues know.
More needful this than glitt’ring wealth
Or aught the world bestows;
Nor reputation, food, or health
Can give us such repose.

Religion should our thoughts engage
Amidst our youthful bloom;
’Twill fit us for declining age
And for the awful tomb.
O may my heart, by grace renewed,
Be my Redeemer’s throne;
And be my stubborn will subdued,
His government to own.

Let deep repentance, faith, and love,
Be joined with godly fear;
And all my conversation prove
My heart to be sincere.
Preserve me from the snares of sin
Through my remaining days,
And in me let each virtue shine,
To my Redeemer’s praise.

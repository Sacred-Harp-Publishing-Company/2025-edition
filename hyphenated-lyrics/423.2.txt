The day is past and gone,
The eve-ning shades ap-pear;
O may we all re-mem-ber well
The night of death is near.

And when our days are past
And we from time re-move,
O may we in Thy bos-om rest,
The bos-om of Thy love.

The day is past and gone,
The evening shades appear;
O may we all remember well
The night of death is near.

And when our days are past
And we from time remove,
O may we in Thy bosom rest,
The bosom of Thy love.

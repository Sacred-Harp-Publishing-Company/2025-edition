# RESTORATION

How man-y years has man been driv’n
Far off from hap-pi-ness and heav’n?
When wilt Thou, gra-cious Lord, re-store
Thy wan-d’ring church to roam no more?

How many years has man been driv’n
Far off from happiness and heav’n?
When wilt Thou, gracious Lord, restore
Thy wand’ring church to roam no more?

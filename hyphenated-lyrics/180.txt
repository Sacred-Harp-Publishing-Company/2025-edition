# VERMONT

In vain we lav-ish out our lives
To gath-er emp-ty wind;
The choic-est bless-ings earth can yield
Will starve a hun-gry mind.
Come, and the Lord shall feed our souls
With more sub-stan-tial meat,
With such as saints in glo-ry love,
With such as an-gels eat.

In vain we lavish out our lives
To gather empty wind;
The choicest blessings earth can yield
Will starve a hungry mind.
Come, and the Lord shall feed our souls
With more substantial meat,
With such as saints in glory love,
With such as angels eat.

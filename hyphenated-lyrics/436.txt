# MORNING SUN

Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By fleet-ing time or con-qu’ring death;
Your morn-ing sun may set at noon,
And leave you ev-er in the dark.
Your spar-kling eyes and bloom-ing cheeks
Must with-er like the blast-ed rose;
The cof-fin, earth, and wind-ing sheet
Will soon your ac-tive limbs en-close.

Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By fleeting time or conqu’ring death;
Your morning sun may set at noon,
And leave you ever in the dark.
Your sparkling eyes and blooming cheeks
Must wither like the blasted rose;
The coffin, earth, and winding sheet
Will soon your active limbs enclose.

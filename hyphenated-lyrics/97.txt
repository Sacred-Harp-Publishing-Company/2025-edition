# WE’LL SOON BE THERE

Oh, who will come and go with me?
We’ll shout and sing Ho-san-na;
I’m bound fair Ca-naan’s land to see,
We’ll shout and sing Ho-san-na.

[chorus]
Go on, go on, we’ll soon be there,
We’ll shout and sing Ho-san-na;
Come on, come on, we’ll soon be there,
We’ll shout and sing Ho-san-na.

Oh, who will come and go with me?
We’ll shout and sing Hosanna;
I’m bound fair Canaan’s land to see,
We’ll shout and sing Hosanna.

[chorus]
Go on, go on, we’ll soon be there,
We’ll shout and sing Hosanna;
Come on, come on, we’ll soon be there,
We’ll shout and sing Hosanna.

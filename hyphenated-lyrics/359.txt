# THE BRIDEâ€™S FAREWELL

Fare-well, Moth-er, tears are stream-ing
Down thy pale and ten-der cheek;
I, in gems and ro-ses gleam-ing,
Scarce this sad fare-well can speak.

Fare-well, Moth-er, now I leave you,
Griefs and hopes my bos-om swell,
One to trust who may de-ceive me:
Fare-well, Moth-er, fare you well.

------

Farewell, Mother, tears are streaming
Down thy pale and tender cheek;
I, in gems and roses gleaming,
Scarce this sad farewell can speak.

Farewell, Mother, now I leave you,
Griefs and hopes my bosom swell,
One to trust who may deceive me:
Farewell, Mother, fare you well.

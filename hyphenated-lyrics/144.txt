# JUBILEE

Hark! the ju-bi-lee is sound-ing,
O the joy-ful news is come;
Free sal-va-tion is pro-claim-ed
In and through God’s on-ly Son.
Now we have the in-vi-ta-tion
To the meek and low-ly Lamb.
Glo-ry, hon-or, and sal-va-tion;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Come, dear friends, and don’t ne-glect it,
Come to Je-sus in your prime;
Great sal-va-tion, don’t re-ject it,
O re-ceive it, now’s your time;
Now the Sav-ior is be-gin-ning
To re-vive His work a-gain.
Glo-ry, hon-or, and sal-va-tion;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Now let each one cease from sin-ning,
Come and fol-low Christ, the way;
We shall all re-ceive a bless-ing,
If from Him we do not stray;
Gold-en mo-ments we’ve ne-glect-ed,
Yet the Lord in-vites a-gain!
Glo-ry, hon-or, and sal-va-tion;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Let us run our race with pa-tience,
Look-ing un-to Christ the Lord,
Who doth live and reign for-ev-er,
With His Fa-ther and our God;
He is wor-thy to be prais-ed,
He is our ex-alt-ed King.
Glo-ry, hon-or, and sal-va-tion;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Come, dear chil-dren, praise your Je-sus,
Praise Him, praise Him ev-er-more;
May His great love now con-strain us
His great name for to a-dore.
O then let us join to-geth-er,
Crowns of glo-ry to ob-tain.
Glo-ry, hon-or, and sal-va-tion;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

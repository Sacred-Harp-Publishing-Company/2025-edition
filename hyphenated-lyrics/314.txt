All hail the pow’r of Je-sus’ name,
Let an-gels pros-trate fall;
Bring forth the roy-al di-a-dem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

[verse 1 chorus]
And crown Him Lord of all,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Bring forth the roy-al di-a-dem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye cho-sen seed of Is-rael’s race,
A rem-nant weak and small,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

[verse 2 chorus]
And crown Him Lord of all,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name,
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

[verse 1 chorus]
And crown Him Lord of all,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race,
A remnant weak and small,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

[verse 2 chorus]
And crown Him Lord of all,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

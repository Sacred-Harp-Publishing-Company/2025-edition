# PETERSBURG

Thus saith the high and loft-y One:
I sit up-on my ho-ly throne;
My name is God, I dwell on high,
Dwell in my own e-ter-ni-ty.
But I de-scend to worlds be-low,
On earth I have a man-sion too;
The hum-ble spir-it and con-trite
Is an a-bode of my de-light.

Thus saith the high and lofty One:
I sit upon my holy throne;
My name is God, I dwell on high,
Dwell in my own eternity.
But I descend to worlds below,
On earth I have a mansion too;
The humble spirit and contrite
Is an abode of my delight.

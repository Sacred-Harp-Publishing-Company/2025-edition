# CROSS OF CHRIST

The cross of Christ in-spires my heart
To sing re-deem-ing grace;
A-wake, my soul, and bear a part
In my Re-deem-er’s praise.
Oh, who can be com-pared to Him
Who died up-on the tree?
This is my dear de-light-ful theme,
That Je-sus died for me.

A glo-rious band, the cho-sen few,
On whom the Spir-it came,
Twelve val-iant saints, their hope they knew,
And mocked the cross and flame;
O God, to us may grace be giv’n
To fol-low in their train.
Through per-il, toil, and pain they climbed
The steep as-cent to heav’n.

The cross of Christ inspires my heart
To sing redeeming grace;
Awake, my soul, and bear a part
In my Redeemer’s praise.
Oh, who can be compared to Him
Who died upon the tree?
This is my dear delightful theme,
That Jesus died for me.

A glorious band, the chosen few,
On whom the Spirit came,
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
And mocked the cross and flame;
O God, to us may grace be giv’n
To follow in their train.
Through peril, toil, and pain they climbed
The steep ascent to heav’n.

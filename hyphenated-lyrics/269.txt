Lord, when Thou didst as-cend on high,
Ten thou-sand an-gels filled the sky;
Those heav’n-ly guards a-round Thee wait,
Like char-iots that at-tend Thy state.
[tenor] Like char-iots, like char-iots,
[treble and bass] Like char-iots, like char-iots that at-tend Thy state.

Lord, when Thou didst ascend on high,
Ten thousand angels filled the sky;
Those heav’nly guards around Thee wait,
Like chariots that attend Thy state.
[tenor] Like chariots, like chariots,
[treble and bass] Like chariots, like chariots that attend Thy state.

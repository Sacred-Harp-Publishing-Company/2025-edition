# THE GREAT REDEEMER

Look up, my soul, with cheer-ful eyes,
See where the great Re-deem-er lives;
I’ll build an al-tar to His name
And to the world pro-claim His grace.

Look up, my soul, with cheerful eyes,
See where the great Redeemer lives;
I’ll build an altar to His name
And to the world proclaim His grace.

Je-sus, Lov-er of my soul,
Let me to Thy bos-om fly,
While the near-er wa-ters roll,
While the tem-pest still is high!
Hide me, O my Sav-ior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe in-to the ha-ven guide;
O re-ceive my soul at last.

Oth-er ref-uge have I none,
Hangs my help-less soul on Thee:
Leave, ah! leave me not a-lone,
Still sup-port and com-fort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cov-er my de-fense-less head
With the shad-ow of Thy wing.

Wilt Thou not re-gard my call?
Wilt Thou not ac-cept my prayer?
Lo! I faint, I sink, I fall;
Lo! on Thee I cast my care.
Reach me out Thy gra-cious hand,
While I of Thy strength re-ceive;
Hop-ing a-gainst hope I stand,
Dy-ing, and be-hold I live!

Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high!
Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide;
O receive my soul at last.

Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:
Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Wilt Thou not regard my call?
Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?
Lo! I faint, I sink, I fall;
Lo! on Thee I cast my care.
Reach me out Thy gracious hand,
While I of Thy strength receive;
Hoping against hope I stand,
Dying, and behold I live!

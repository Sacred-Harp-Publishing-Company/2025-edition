# REES

There is a house not made with hands,
E-ter-nal and on high;
And here my spir-it wait-ing stands,
Till God shall bid it fly.

[chorus]
I long to see my friends a-gain,
And hear them sweet-ly say:
“Come, wea-ry dove, here is thy home,
Then fold thy wings and stay.”

Short-ly this pris-on of my clay
Must be dis-solved and fall;
Then, O my soul, with joy o-bey
Thy heav’n-ly Fa-ther’s call.

’Tis He, by His al-might-y grace,
That forms thee fit for heav’n;
And as an ear-nest of the place
Has His own Spir-it giv’n.

There is a house not made with hands,
Eternal and on high;
And here my spirit waiting stands,
Till God shall bid it fly.

[chorus]
I long to see my friends again,
And hear them sweetly say:
“Come, weary dove, here is thy home,
Then fold thy wings and stay.”

Shortly this prison of my clay
Must be dissolved and fall;
Then, O my soul, with joy obey
Thy heav’nly Father’s call.

’Tis He, by His almighty grace,
That forms thee fit for heav’n;
And as an earnest of the place
Has His own Spirit giv’n.

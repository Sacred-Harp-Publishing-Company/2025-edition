# FUNERAL ANTHEM

I heard a great voice from heav’n say-ing un-to me,
Write from hence-forth, Bless-ed are the dead that die in the Lord:
Yea, saith the Spir-it, for they rest
From their la-bors
And their works which do fol-low,
which do fol-low them,
Which do fol-low them.

I heard a great voice from heav’n saying unto me,
Write from henceforth, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord:
Yea, saith the Spirit, for they rest
From their labors
And their works which do follow,
which do follow them,
Which do follow them.

# REBEKAH

Ye saints of ev-’ry rank, with joy
To God your of-f’rings bring;
Let towns and cit-ies, hills and vales,
With loud ho-san-nas ring.

Let Him re-ceive the glo-ry due
To His ex-alt-ed name;
With thank-ful tongues and hearts in-flamed
His won-drous deeds pro-claim.

Let Him receive the glory due
To His exalted name;
With thankful tongues and hearts inflamed
His wondrous deeds proclaim.

# LOVING JESUS

Here’s my heart, my lov-ing Je-sus—
Thou who didst from sin re-lieve us;
Take the pur-chase of Thy blood!
Lov-ing Je-sus, Thou hast bought a ran-som!

[treble, tenor]
Glo-ry, glo-ry, hon-or, praise, and pow-er,
Glo-ry, glo-ry to the Lord!

[alto, bass]
Glo-ry, hon-or, praise, and pow-er
Be un-to the Lamb for-ev-er!
Glo-ry, glo-ry to the Lord!

Here’s my heart, my loving Jesus—
Thou who didst from sin relieve us;
Take the purchase of Thy blood!
Loving Jesus, Thou hast bought a ransom!

[treble, tenor]
Glory, glory, honor, praise, and power,
Glory, glory to the Lord!

[alto, bass]
Glory, honor, praise, and power
Be unto the Lamb forever!
Glory, glory to the Lord!

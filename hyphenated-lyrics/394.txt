# THE MESSIAH’S PRAISE

My heart and voice I raise
To spread Mes-si-ah’s praise:
Mes-si-ah’s praise—let all re-peat:
The u-ni-ver-sal Lord,
Praise Him,
Let all praise Him,
By whose al-might-y word
Cre-a-tion rose in form com-plete.

My heart and voice I raise
To spread Messiah’s praise:
Messiah’s praise—let all repeat:
The universal Lord,
Praise Him,
Let all praise Him,
By whose almighty word
Creation rose in form complete.

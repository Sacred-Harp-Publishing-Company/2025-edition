# SOLDIER OF THE CROSS

Am I a sol-dier of the cross,
A fol-l’wer of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

[verse 1 chorus]
Or blush to speak His name,
Or blush to speak His name,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A foll’wer of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

[verse 1 chorus]
Or blush to speak His name,
Or blush to speak His name,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

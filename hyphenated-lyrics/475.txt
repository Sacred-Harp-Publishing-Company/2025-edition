# A THANKFUL HEART

Give me a calm, a thank-ful heart
From ev-’ry mur-mur free;
The bless-ing of Thy grace im-part,
And make me live to Thee.

Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine
My life and death at-tend;
Thy pres-ence through my jour-ney shine,
And crown my jour-ney’s end.

Give me a calm, a thankful heart
From ev’ry murmur free;
The blessing of Thy grace impart,
And make me live to Thee.

Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine
My life and death attend;
Thy presence through my journey shine,
And crown my journey’s end.

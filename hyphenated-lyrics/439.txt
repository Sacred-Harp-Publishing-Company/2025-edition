# JORDAN

On Jor-dan’s storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a wish-ful eye
To Ca-naan’s fair and hap-py land
Where my pos-ses-sions lie.
Oh, the trans-port-ing, rap-t’rous scene
That ris-es to my sight!
Sweet fields ar-rayed in liv-ing green,
And riv-ers of de-light.

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.
Oh, the transporting, rapt’rous scene
That rises to my sight!
Sweet fields arrayed in living green,
And rivers of delight.

# SACRED THRONE

Be-neath the sa-cred throne of God
I saw a riv-er rise;
The streams were peace and par-d’ning blood
De-scend-ing from the skies.

I stood a-mazed and won-dered when
Or why this o-cean rose
That wafts sal-va-tion down to men,
His trai-tors and His foes.

That sa-cred flood from Je-sus’ veins
Was free to take a-way
A Ma-ry’s or Ma-nas-seh’s stains
Or sins more vile than they.

Beneath the sacred throne of God
I saw a river rise;
The streams were peace and pard’ning blood
Descending from the skies.

I stood amazed and wondered when
Or why this ocean rose
That wafts salvation down to men,
His traitors and His foes.

That sacred flood from Jesus’ veins
Was free to take away
A Mary’s or Manasseh’s stains
Or sins more vile than they.

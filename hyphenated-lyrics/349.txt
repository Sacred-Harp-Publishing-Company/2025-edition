# A CROSS FOR ME

Must Je-sus bear the cross a-lone,
And all the world go free?
No, there’s a cross for ev-’ry-one,
And there’s a cross for me.

The con-se-crat-ed cross I’ll bear
Till death shall set me free;
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there’s a crown for me.

------

Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there’s a cross for ev’ryone,
And there’s a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I’ll bear
Till death shall set me free;
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there’s a crown for me.

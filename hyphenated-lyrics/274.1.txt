# THE GOLDEN HARP

Fare-well, vain world, I’m go-ing home
To play on the gold-en harp.
My Sav-ior smiles and bids me come
To play on the gold-en harp.

[chorus]
To play on the gold-en harp,
To play on the gold-en harp.
I want to be where Je-sus is,
To play on the gold-en harp.

Sweet an-gels beck-on me a-way
To play on the gold-en harp.
To sing God’s praise in end-less day,
To play on the gold-en harp.

------

Farewell, vain world, I’m going home
To play on the golden harp.
My Savior smiles and bids me come
To play on the golden harp.

[chorus]
To play on the golden harp,
To play on the golden harp.
I want to be where Jesus is,
To play on the golden harp.

Sweet angels beckon me away
To play on the golden harp.
To sing God’s praise in endless day,
To play on the golden harp.

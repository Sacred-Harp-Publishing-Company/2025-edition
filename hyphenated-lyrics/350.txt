O for a thou-sand tongues to sing
My great Re-deem-er’s praise,
The glo-ries of my God and King,
The tri-umphs of His grace!

He breaks the pow’r of can-celed sin,
He sets the pris-’ner free;
His blood can make the foul-est clean,
His blood a-vailed for me.

My gra-cious Mas-ter and my God,
As-sist me to pro-claim,
To spread through all the earth a-broad
The hon-ors of Thy name.

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

He breaks the pow’r of canceled sin,
He sets the pris’ner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name.

O that I could re-pent!
With all my i-dols part,
And to Thy gra-cious eye pre-sent
A hum-ble, con-trite heart.

A heart with grief op-pressed
For hav-ing grieved my God,
A trou-bled heart that can-not rest
Till sprin-kled with Thy blood.

Je-sus, on me be-stow
The pen-i-tent de-sire;
With true sin-cer-i-ty of woe
My ach-ing breast in-spire.

With soft-’ning pit-y look,
And melt my hard-ness down;
Strike with Thy love’s re-sist-less stroke,
And break this heart of stone.

O that I could repent!
With all my idols part,
And to Thy gracious eye present
A humble, contrite heart.

A heart with grief oppressed
For having grieved my God,
A troubled heart that cannot rest
Till sprinkled with Thy blood.

Jesus, on me bestow
The penitent desire;
With true sincerity of woe
My aching breast inspire.

With soft’ning pity look,
And melt my hardness down;
Strike with Thy love’s resistless stroke,
And break this heart of stone.

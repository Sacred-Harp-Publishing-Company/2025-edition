# LEANDER

My soul for-sakes her vain de-light
And bids the world fare-well,
Base as the dirt be-neath the feet
And mis-chie-vous as hell.
No long-er will I ask your love,
Nor seek your friend-ship more;
The hap-pi-ness that I ap-prove
Is not with-in your pow’r.

There’s noth-ing round this spa-cious earth
That suits my soul’s de-sire;
To bound-less joy and sol-id mirth
My no-bler thoughts as-pire.
Oh, for the pin-ions of a dove
To mount the heav’n-ly road;
There shall I share my Sav-ior’s love,
There shall I dwell with God.

My soul forsakes her vain delight
And bids the world farewell,
Base as the dirt beneath the feet
And mischievous as hell.
No longer will I ask your love,
Nor seek your friendship more;
The happiness that I approve
Is not within your pow’r.

There’s nothing round this spacious earth
That suits my soul’s desire;
To boundless joy and solid mirth
My nobler thoughts aspire.
Oh, for the pinions of a dove
To mount the heav’nly road;
There shall I share my Savior’s love,
There shall I dwell with God.

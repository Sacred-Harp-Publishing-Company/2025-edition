# ZION

While trav-’ling down life’s wea-ry road
Of trou-bles and de-spair,
We some-times long for peace and joy
That waits God’s chil-dren there.
No pain nor death will we see there
On that de-light-ful shore,
But all will be peace, joy, and love
With Christ for-ev-er-more.

While trav’ling down life’s weary road
Of troubles and despair,
We sometimes long for peace and joy
That waits God’s children there.
No pain nor death will we see there
On that delightful shore,
But all will be peace, joy, and love
With Christ forevermore.

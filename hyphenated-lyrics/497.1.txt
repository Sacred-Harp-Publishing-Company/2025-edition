Bleed-ing hearts de-filed by sin,
Je-sus Christ can make you clean;
Con-trite souls with guilt op-pressed,
Je-sus Christ can give you rest.

[chorus]
Sweet Re-deem-er from a-bove,
Borne on wings of love.

You that mourn your fol-lies past,
Pre-cious hours and years laid waste,
Turn to God, O turn and live;
Je-sus Christ can still for-give.

Faint-ing souls in per-il’s hour,
Yield not to the Temp-ter’s pow’r;
On the ris-en Lord re-ly;
Je-sus Christ now reigns on high.

Bleeding hearts defiled by sin,
Jesus Christ can make you clean;
Contrite souls with guilt oppressed,
Jesus Christ can give you rest.

[chorus]
Sweet Redeemer from above,
Borne on wings of love.

You that mourn your follies past,
Precious hours and years laid waste,
Turn to God, O turn and live;
Jesus Christ can still forgive.

Fainting souls in peril’s hour,
Yield not to the Tempter’s pow’r;
On the risen Lord rely;
Jesus Christ now reigns on high.

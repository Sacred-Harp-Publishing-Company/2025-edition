# BAPTISMAL ANTHEM

In those days came John the Bap-tist, preach-ing in the wil-der-ness of Ju-de-a,
And say-ing, Re-pent ye,
For the king-dom of heav-en is at hand,
For this is he that was spo-ken of by the proph-et E-sai-as, say-ing,
The voice of one cry-ing in the wil-der-ness,
Pre-pare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.
And this same John had his rai-ment of cam-el’s hair
And bound with a leath-ern gir-dle; and his meat was lo-custs and wild hon-ey.

In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
And saying, Repent ye,
For the kingdom of heaven is at hand,
For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,
The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.
And this same John had his raiment of camel’s hair
And bound with a leathern girdle; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.

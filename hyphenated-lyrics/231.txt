O what are all my suf-f’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that en-rap-tured host t’ap-pear,
And wor-ship at Thy feet!

Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends a-way,
But let me find them all a-gain
In that e-ter-nal day.

O what are all my suff’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that enraptured host t’appear,
And worship at Thy feet!

Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends away,
But let me find them all again
In that eternal day.

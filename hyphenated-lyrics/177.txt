# THE CHRISTIAN’S FLIGHT

Not man-y years their rounds shall roll;
Each mo-ment brings it nigh,
When the Chris-tian’s soul
To heav’n a-bove shall fly.
Ye wheels of na-ture, speed your course,
Ye mor-tal pow’rs, de-cay;
Fast as ye bring the night of death,
Ye bring e-ter-nal day.

------

Not many years their rounds shall roll;
Each moment brings it nigh,
When the Christian’s soul
To heav’n above shall fly.
Ye wheels of nature, speed your course,
Ye mortal pow’rs, decay;
Fast as ye bring the night of death,
Ye bring eternal day.

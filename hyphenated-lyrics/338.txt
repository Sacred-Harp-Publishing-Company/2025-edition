# SAWYERâ€™S EXIT

How bright is the day when the Chris-tian
Re-ceives the sweet mes-sage to come,
To rise to the man-sions of glo-ry,
And be there for-ev-er at home,

[verse 1 chorus]
And be there for-ev-er at home,
And be there for-ev-er at home,
To rise to the man-sions of glo-ry,
And be there for-ev-er at home.

The an-gels stand read-y and wait-ing,
The mo-ment the spir-it is gone,
To car-ry it up-ward to heav-en,
And wel-come it safe-ly at home,

[verse 2 chorus]
And wel-come it safe-ly at home,
And wel-come it safe-ly at home,
To car-ry it up-ward to heav-en,
And wel-come it safe-ly at home.

The saints that have gone up be-fore us
All raise a new shout as we come,
And sing hal-le-lu-jah the loud-er
To wel-come the trav-el-ers home,

[verse 3 chorus]
To wel-come the trav-el-ers home,
To wel-come the trav-el-ers home,
And sing hal-le-lu-jah the loud-er,
To wel-come the trav-el-ers home.

How bright is the day when the Christian
Receives the sweet message to come,
To rise to the mansions of glory,
And be there forever at home,

[verse 1 chorus]
And be there forever at home,
And be there forever at home,
To rise to the mansions of glory,
And be there forever at home.

The angels stand ready and waiting,
The moment the spirit is gone,
To carry it upward to heaven,
And welcome it safely at home,

[verse 2 chorus]
And welcome it safely at home,
And welcome it safely at home,
To carry it upward to heaven,
And welcome it safely at home.

The saints that have gone up before us
All raise a new shout as we come,
And sing hallelujah the louder
To welcome the travelers home,

[verse 3 chorus]
To welcome the travelers home,
To welcome the travelers home,
And sing hallelujah the louder,
To welcome the travelers home.

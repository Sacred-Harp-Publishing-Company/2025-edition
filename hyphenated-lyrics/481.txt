Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet ac-cord,
And thus sur-round the throne.

Then let our songs a-bound,
And ev-’ry tear be dry;
We’re march-ing through Im-man-uel’s ground
To fair-er worlds on high.

And thus surround the throne.

Then let our songs abound,
And ev’ry tear be dry;
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground
To fairer worlds on high.

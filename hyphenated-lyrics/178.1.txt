Now shall my in-ward joys a-rise
And burst in-to a song;
Al-might-y love in-spires my heart,
And pleas-ure tunes my tongue.

God, on His thirst-y Zi-on’s hill,
Some mer-cy drops has thrown;
And sol-emn oaths have bound His love
To show’r sal-va-tion down.

Why do we then in-dulge our fears,
Sus-pi-cions and com-plaints?
Is He a God, and shall His grace
Grow wea-ry of His saints?

Now shall my inward joys arise
And burst into a song;
Almighty love inspires my heart,
And pleasure tunes my tongue.

God, on His thirsty Zion’s hill,
Some mercy drops has thrown;
And solemn oaths have bound His love
To show’r salvation down.

Why do we then indulge our fears,
Suspicions and complaints?
Is He a God, and shall His grace
Grow weary of His saints?

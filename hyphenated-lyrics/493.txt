# BLESSED ROAD

Rise, O my soul, pur-sue the path
By an-cient he-roes trod;
As-pir-ing view those ho-ly men
Who lived and walked with God.
Though dead, they speak in reas-on’s ear
And in ex-am-ple live;
Their faith and hope and might-y deeds
Still fresh in-struc-tion give.

’Twas through the Lamb’s most pre-cious blood
They con-quered ev-’ry foe,
And to His pow’r and match-less grace
Their crowns and hon-ors owe.
Lord, may I ev-er keep in view
The pat-terns Thou hast giv’n,
And ne’er for-sake the bless-ed road
Which led them safe to heav’n.

Rise, O my soul, pursue the path
By ancient heroes trod;
Aspiring view those holy men
Who lived and walked with God.
Though dead, they speak in reason’s ear
And in example live;
Their faith and hope and mighty deeds
Still fresh instruction give.

’Twas through the Lamb’s most precious blood
They conquered ev’ry foe,
And to His pow’r and matchless grace
Their crowns and honors owe.
Lord, may I ever keep in view
The patterns Thou hast giv’n,
And ne’er forsake the blessed road
Which led them safe to heav’n.

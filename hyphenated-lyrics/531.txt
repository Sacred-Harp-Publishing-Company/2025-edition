# CLAYTON

A bro-ken heart, my God, my King,
To Thee a sac-ri-fice I bring;
The God of grace will ne’er de-spise
A bro-ken heart for sac-ri-fice.

My soul lies hum-bled in the dust
And owns Thy dread-ful sen-tence just;
Look down, O Lord, with pity-ing eye,
And save the soul con-demned to die.

O may Thy love in-spire my tongue!
Sal-va-tion shall be all my song;
And all my pow’rs shall join to bless
The Lord, my strength and right-eous-ness.

------

A broken heart, my God, my King,
To Thee a sacrifice I bring;
The God of grace will ne’er despise
A broken heart for sacrifice.

My soul lies humbled in the dust
And owns Thy dreadful sentence just;
Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye,
And save the soul condemned to die.

O may Thy love inspire my tongue!
Salvation shall be all my song;
And all my pow’rs shall join to bless
The Lord, my strength and righteousness.

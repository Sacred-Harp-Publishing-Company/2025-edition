# FAMILY BIBLE

How pain-ful-ly pleas-ing the fond rec-ol-lec-tion
Of youth-ful con-nec-tion and in-no-cent joy,
While blest with pa-ren-tal ad-vice and af-fec-tion,
Sur-round-ed with mer-cy and peace from on high.
I still view the chairs of my fa-ther and moth-er,
The seats of their off-spring, as ranged on each hand,
And the rich-est of books, which ex-cels ev-’ry oth-er,
The fam-i-ly Bi-ble that lay on the stand,
The rich-est of books, which ex-cels ev-’ry oth-er,
The fam-i-ly Bi-ble that lay on the stand.

The Bi-ble, that vol-ume of God’s in-spi-ra-tion,
At morn-ing and eve-ning could yield us de-light.
The prayers of our fa-ther, a sweet in-vo-ca-tion,
For mer-cy by day and for safe-ty at night.
O hymns of thanks-giv-ing with har-mo-nious sweet-ness,
As warmed by the hearts of the fam-i-ly band,
Hath raised us from earth to that rap-tur-ous dwell-ing,
De-scribed in the Bi-ble that lay on the stand,
Hath raised us from earth to that rap-tur-ous dwell-ing,
De-scribed in the Bi-ble that lay on the stand.

How painfully pleasing the fond recollection
Of youthful connection and innocent joy,
While blest with parental advice and affection,
Surrounded with mercy and peace from on high.
I still view the chairs of my father and mother,
The seats of their offspring, as ranged on each hand,
And the richest of books, which excels ev’ry other,
The family Bible that lay on the stand,
The richest of books, which excels ev’ry other,
The family Bible that lay on the stand.

The Bible, that volume of God’s inspiration,
At morning and evening could yield us delight.
The prayers of our father, a sweet invocation,
For mercy by day and for safety at night.
O hymns of thanksgiving with harmonious sweetness,
As warmed by the hearts of the family band,
Hath raised us from earth to that rapturous dwelling,
Described in the Bible that lay on the stand,
Hath raised us from earth to that rapturous dwelling,
Described in the Bible that lay on the stand.

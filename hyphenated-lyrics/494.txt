While my Re-deem-er’s near,
My Shep-herd and my Guide,
I bid fare-well to ev-’ry fear;
My wants are all sup-plied.

To ev-er-fra-grant meads,
Where rich a-bun-dance grows,
His gra-cious hand in-dul-gent leads,
And guards my sweet re-pose.

While my Redeemer’s near,
My Shepherd and my Guide,
I bid farewell to ev’ry fear;
My wants are all supplied.

To ever-fragrant meads,
Where rich abundance grows,
His gracious hand indulgent leads,
And guards my sweet repose.

# PROTECTION

The Lord my pas-ture shall pre-pare,
And feed me with a shep-herd’s care;
His pres-ence shall my wants sup-ply,
And guard me with a watch-ful eye.
My noon-day walks He shall at-tend,
My noon-day walks He shall at-tend
And all my mid-night hours de-fend.

With gloom-y hor-rors o-ver-spread,
Though in the paths of death I tread,
My stead-fast heart shall fear no ill,
For Thou, O Lord, art with me still,
For Thou, O Lord, art with me still;
Thy friend-ly crook shall give me aid,
And guide me through the dread-ful shade.

------

The Lord my pasture shall prepare,
And feed me with a shepherd’s care;
His presence shall my wants supply,
And guard me with a watchful eye.
My noonday walks He shall attend,
My noonday walks He shall attend
And all my midnight hours defend.

With gloomy horrors overspread,
Though in the paths of death I tread,
My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,
For Thou, O Lord, art with me still,
For Thou, O Lord, art with me still;
Thy friendly crook shall give me aid,
And guide me through the dreadful shade.

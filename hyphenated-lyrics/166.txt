Teach me how to do my du-ty
In the ser-vice of my Lord.
Then, when time with me is o-ver,
I’ll re-ceive the great re-ward.
And with Je-sus Christ, my Sav-ior,
I shall live in end-less day,
Where my sor-rows and my toil-ing
Shall be ban-ished far a-way.

Teach me how to do my duty
In the service of my Lord.
Then, when time with me is over,
I’ll receive the great reward.
And with Jesus Christ, my Savior,
I shall live in endless day,
Where my sorrows and my toiling
Shall be banished far away.

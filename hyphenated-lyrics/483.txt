# GOLDEN GARDENS

The heav’ns God’s glo-ry do de-clare;
The skies His hand-works preach;
Day ut-ters speech to day, and night
To night doth knowl-edge teach.
There is no speech nor tongue to which
Their voice doth not ex-tend;
Their line is gone through all the earth,
Their words to the world’s end.

The heav’ns God’s glory do declare;
The skies His handworks preach;
Day utters speech to day, and night
To night doth knowledge teach.
There is no speech nor tongue to which
Their voice doth not extend;
Their line is gone through all the earth,
Their words to the world’s end.

# THE SPIRIT SHALL RETURN

When the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars
Be not dark-ened, or the clouds re-turn af-ter the rain, or the sil-ver cord be loosed,
Then shall the dust re-turn to the earth as it was,
And the spir-it shall re-turn un-to God, who gave it.

When the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars
Be not darkened, or the clouds return after the rain, or the silver cord be loosed,
Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was,
And the spirit shall return unto God, who gave it.

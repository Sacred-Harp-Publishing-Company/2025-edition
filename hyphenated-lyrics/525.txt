I love Thee, my Sav-ior; I love Thee, my Lord;
I love Thy dear peo-ple, Thy ways, and Thy word;
With ten-der e-mo-tion I love sin-ners too,
Since Je-sus has died to re-deem them from woe.

I find Him in sing-ing; I find Him in prayer;
In sweet med-i-ta-tion He al-ways is near;
My con-stant com-pan-ion, O may we ne’er part!
All glo-ry to Je-sus, He dwells in my heart.

I love Thee, my Savior; I love Thee, my Lord;
I love Thy dear people, Thy ways, and Thy word;
With tender emotion I love sinners too,
Since Jesus has died to redeem them from woe.

I find Him in singing; I find Him in prayer;
In sweet meditation He always is near;
My constant companion, O may we ne’er part!
All glory to Jesus, He dwells in my heart.

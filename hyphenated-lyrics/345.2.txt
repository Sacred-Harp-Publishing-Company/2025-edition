# I’M ON MY JOURNEY HOME

Oh, who will come and go with me?
I am on my jour-ney home.
I’m bound fair Ca-naan’s land to see,
I am on my jour-ney home.

[chorus]
Oh, come and go with me,
For I’m on my jour-ney home.

------

Oh, who will come and go with me?
I am on my journey home.
I’m bound fair Canaan’s land to see,
I am on my journey home.

[chorus]
Oh, come and go with me,
For I’m on my journey home.

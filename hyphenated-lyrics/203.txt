Let sin-ners take their course,
And choose the road to death;
But in the wor-ship of my God
I’ll spend my dai-ly breath.

My thoughts ad-dress His throne
When morn-ing brings the light;
I seek His bless-ings ev-’ry noon,
And pay my vows at night.

Let sinners take their course,
And choose the road to death;
But in the worship of my God
I’ll spend my daily breath.

My thoughts address His throne
When morning brings the light;
I seek His blessings ev’ry noon,
And pay my vows at night.

# TIDES OF LOVE

The cheer-ful wa-ters nev-er cease—
What swell-ing tides of love,
Cas-cad-ing in such per-fect peace,
Down from God’s throne a-bove!

The foun-tain flows, a pre-cious flood,
Its cur-rents nev-er end,
As pure and sweet as Je-sus’ blood
That cov-ered all our sin.

The cheerful waters never cease—
What swelling tides of love,
Cascading in such perfect peace,
Down from God’s throne above!

The fountain flows, a precious flood,
Its currents never end,
As pure and sweet as Jesus’ blood
That covered all our sin.

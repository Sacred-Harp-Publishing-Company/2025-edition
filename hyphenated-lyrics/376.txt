# HELP ME TO SING

Ye souls who are bound un-to Ca-naan,
Come join in and help me to sing
The prais-es of my lov-ing Je-sus,
My Proph-et, my Priest, and my King.
His name is most sweet-ly me-lo-dious,
’Twill help you most swift-ly to move;
While Je-sus Him-self is the lead-er,
We’re bound by the cords of His love.

------

Ye souls who are bound unto Canaan,
Come join in and help me to sing
The praises of my loving Jesus,
My Prophet, my Priest, and my King.
His name is most sweetly melodious,
’Twill help you most swiftly to move;
While Jesus Himself is the leader,
We’re bound by the cords of His love.

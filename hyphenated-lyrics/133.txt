# HEBREW CHILDREN

Where are the He-brew chil-dren?
Safe in the prom-ised land.
Though the fur-nace flamed a-round them,
God, while in their trou-bles, found them;
He with love and mer-cy bound them,
Safe in the prom-ised land.

Where are the twelve a-pos-tles?
Safe in the prom-ised land.
They went up through pain and sigh-ing,
Scoff-ing, scourg-ing, cru-ci-fy-ing,
No-bly for their Mas-ter dy-ing,
Safe in the prom-ised land.

Where are the ho-ly Chris-tians?
Safe in the prom-ised land.
Those who’ve washed their robes and made them
White and spot-less, pure, and laid them
Where no earth-ly stain can fade them,
Safe in the prom-ised land.

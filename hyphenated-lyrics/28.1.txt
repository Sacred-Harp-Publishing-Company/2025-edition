# AYLESBURY

The God we wor-ship now
Will guide us till we die,
Will be our God while here be-low,
And ours a-bove the sky.

How de-cent and how wise!
How glo-rious to be-hold,
Be-yond the pomp that charms the eye
And rites a-dorned with gold.

Far as Thy name is known,
The world de-clares Thy praise;
Thy saints, O Lord, be-fore Thy throne
Their songs of hon-or raise.

The God we worship now
Will guide us till we die,
Will be our God while here below,
And ours above the sky.

How decent and how wise!
How glorious to behold,
Beyond the pomp that charms the eye
And rites adorned with gold.

Far as Thy name is known,
The world declares Thy praise;
Thy saints, O Lord, before Thy throne
Their songs of honor raise.

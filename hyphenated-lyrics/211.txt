Je-sus shall reign wher-e’er the sun
Does his suc-ces-sive jour-neys run;
His king-dom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
To Him shall end-less prayer be made,
And prais-es throng to crown His head;
His name like sweet per-fume shall rise
With ev-’ry morn-ing sac-ri-fice.

Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
To Him shall endless prayer be made,
And praises throng to crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With ev’ry morning sacrifice.

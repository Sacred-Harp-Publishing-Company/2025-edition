# PHOEBUS

Lord, in the morn-ing Thou shalt hear
My voice as-cend-ing high;
To Thee will I di-rect my prayer,
To Thee lift up mine eye;
Up to the hills where Christ is gone
To plead for all His saints,
Pre-sent-ing at His Fa-ther’s throne
Our songs and our com-plaints.

Thou art a God be-fore whose sight
The wick-ed shall not stand;
Sin-ners shall ne’er be Thy de-light,
Nor dwell at Thy right hand;
But to Thy house will I re-sort,
To taste Thy mer-cies there;
Thy word in-to our minds in-still;
And wor-ship in Thy fear.

Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear
My voice ascending high;
To Thee will I direct my prayer,
To Thee lift up mine eye;
Up to the hills where Christ is gone
To plead for all His saints,
Presenting at His Father’s throne
Our songs and our complaints.

Thou art a God before whose sight
The wicked shall not stand;
Sinners shall ne’er be Thy delight,
Nor dwell at Thy right hand;
But to Thy house will I resort,
To taste Thy mercies there;
Thy word into our minds instill;
And worship in Thy fear.

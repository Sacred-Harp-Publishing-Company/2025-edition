# CHESTER

Let the high heav’ns your songs in-vite,
Those spa-cious fields of bril-liant light,
Where sun and moon and plan-ets roll,
And stars that glow from pole to pole.

Sun, moon and stars con-vey Thy praise
Round the whole earth and nev-er stand:
So, when Thy truth be-gan its race,
It touched and glanced on ev-’ry land.

Let the high heav’ns your songs invite,
Those spacious fields of brilliant light,
Where sun and moon and planets roll,
And stars that glow from pole to pole.

Sun, moon and stars convey Thy praise
Round the whole earth and never stand:
So, when Thy truth began its race,
It touched and glanced on ev’ry land.

Ye chil-dren of Je-sus, who’re bound for the king-dom,
At-tune all your voic-es, and help me to sing
Sweet an-thems of prais-es to my lov-ing Je-sus,
For He is my Proph-et, my Priest, and my King.
When Je-sus first found me to hell I was go-ing,
His love did sur-round me and saved me from ru-in;
He kind-ly em-braced me, and sweet-ly He kissed me,
And taught me a-loud His sweet prais-es to sing.

Why should you go mourn-ing from such a phy-si-cian,
Who’s a-ble and will-ing your sick-ness to cure?
Come to Him be-liev-ing, though bad your con-di-tion;
His Fa-ther has prom-ised your ease to en-sure.
He brought me to Zi-on to join the glad voic-es,
My soul He hath heal-ed, my heart hath re-joic-ed;
I’ll serve Him and praise Him and al-ways a-dore Him
Till we meet in heav-en, where part-ing’s no more.

Ye children of Jesus, who’re bound for the kingdom,
Attune all your voices, and help me to sing
Sweet anthems of praises to my loving Jesus,
For He is my Prophet, my Priest, and my King.
When Jesus first found me to hell I was going,
His love did surround me and saved me from ruin;
He kindly embraced me, and sweetly He kissed me,
And taught me aloud His sweet praises to sing.

Why should you go mourning from such a physician,
Who’s able and willing your sickness to cure?
Come to Him believing, though bad your condition;
His Father has promised your ease to ensure.
He brought me to Zion to join the glad voices,
My soul He hath healed, my heart hath rejoiced;
I’ll serve Him and praise Him and always adore Him
Till we meet in heaven, where parting’s no more.

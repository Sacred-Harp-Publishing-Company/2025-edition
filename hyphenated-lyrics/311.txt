Come, sound His praise a-broad,
And hymns of glo-ry sing;
Je-ho-vah is the sov-’reign Lord,
The u-ni-ver-sal King.
Praise ye the Lord,
Hal-le-lu-jah,
Praise ye the Lord,
Hal-le-lu-jah, hal-le-lu-jah, hal-le-lu-jah, hal-le-lu-jah,
Praise ye the Lord!

Come, sound His praise abroad,
And hymns of glory sing;
Jehovah is the sov’reign Lord,
The universal King.
Praise ye the Lord,
Hallelujah,
Praise ye the Lord,
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
Praise ye the Lord!

# MINISTER’S FAREWELL

Dear friends, fare-well! I do you tell,
Since you and I must part;
I go a-way, and here you stay,
But still we’re joined at heart.
Your love to me has been most free,
Your con-ver-sa-tion sweet;
How can I bear to jour-ney where
With you I can-not meet?

I trust you’ll pray both night and day,
And keep your gar-ments white,
For you and me, that we may be
The chil-dren of the light.
If you die first, a-non you must,
The will of God be done;
I hope the Lord will you re-ward
With an im-mor-tal crown.

Dear friends, farewell! I do you tell,
Since you and I must part;
I go away, and here you stay,
But still we’re joined at heart.
Your love to me has been most free,
Your conversation sweet;
How can I bear to journey where
With you I cannot meet?

I trust you’ll pray both night and day,
And keep your garments white,
For you and me, that we may be
The children of the light.
If you die first, anon you must,
The will of God be done;
I hope the Lord will you reward
With an immortal crown.

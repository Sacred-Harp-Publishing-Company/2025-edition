Come, hum-ble sin-ner, in whose breast
A thou-sand thoughts re-volve;
Come, with your guilt and fear op-pressed,
And make this last re-solve.

I’ll go to Je-sus, though my sin
Hath like a moun-tain rose;
I know His courts, I’ll en-ter in,
What-ev-er may op-pose.

I can but per-ish if I go;
I am re-solved to try;
For if I stay a-way, I know,
I must for-ev-er die.

Come, humble sinner, in whose breast
A thousand thoughts revolve;
Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed,
And make this last resolve.

I’ll go to Jesus, though my sin
Hath like a mountain rose;
I know His courts, I’ll enter in,
Whatever may oppose.

I can but perish if I go;
I am resolved to try;
For if I stay away, I know,
I must forever die.

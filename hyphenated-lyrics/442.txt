# NEW JORDAN

On Jor-dan’s storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a wish-ful eye
To Ca-naan’s fair and hap-py land
Where my pos-ses-sions lie.
Oh, the trans-port-ing, rap-t’rous scene
That ris-es to my sight!
Sweet fields ar-rayed in liv-ing green,
And riv-ers of de-light.

There gen-’rous fruits that nev-er fail
On trees im-mor-tal grow;
There rocks and hills, and brooks and vales,
With milk and hon-ey flow.
All o’er those wide, ex-tend-ed plains
Shines one e-ter-nal day;
There God the Son for-ev-er reigns
And scat-ters night a-way.

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.
Oh, the transporting, rapt’rous scene
That rises to my sight!
Sweet fields arrayed in living green,
And rivers of delight.

There gen’rous fruits that never fail
On trees immortal grow;
There rocks and hills, and brooks and vales,
With milk and honey flow.
All o’er those wide, extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away.

Gen-tly glides the stream of life,
Oft a-long the flow-’ry vale;
Or im-pet-uous down the cliff,
Rush-ing roars when storms as-sail.
Life’s an ev-er var-ied flood,
Al-ways roll-ing to its sea;
Slow, or quick, or mild, or rude,
Tend-ing to e-ter-ni-ty.

Gently glides the stream of life,
Oft along the flow’ry vale;
Or impetuous down the cliff,
Rushing roars when storms assail.
Life’s an ever varied flood,
Always rolling to its sea;
Slow, or quick, or mild, or rude,
Tending to eternity.

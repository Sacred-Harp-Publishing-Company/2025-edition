# PARTING FRIENDS

Our cheer-ful voic-es let us raise
And sing a part-ing song;
Al-though I’m with you now, my friends,
I can’t be with you long.
For I must go and leave you all;
It fills my heart with pain;
Al-though we part, per-haps in tears,
I hope we’ll meet a-gain.

Our cheerful voices let us raise
And sing a parting song;
Although I’m with you now, my friends,
I can’t be with you long.
For I must go and leave you all;
It fills my heart with pain;
Although we part, perhaps in tears,
I hope we’ll meet again.

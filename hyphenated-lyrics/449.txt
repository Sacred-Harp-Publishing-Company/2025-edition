# LOVELY SOCIAL BAND

Say, now, ye love-ly so-cial band,
Who walk the way to Ca-naan’s land,
Ye who have fled from So-dom’s plain,
Say, do you wish to turn a-gain?
O have you ven-tured to the field,
Well armed with hel-met, sword, and shield?
And shall the world, with dread a-larms,
Com-pel you now to ground your arms?

Be-hold! I see, a-mong the rest,
A host in rich-er gar-ments dressed,
A host that near His pres-ence stands,
And palms of vic-t’ry grace their hands.
Say, who are these I now be-hold,
With blood-washed robes and crowns of gold?
This glo-rious host is not un-known
To Him who sits up-on the throne.

These are the fol-l’wers of the Lamb;
From trib-u-la-tion great they came;
And on the hill of sweet re-pose
They bid a-dieu to all their woes.
Soon on the wings of love you’ll fly,
To join them in that world on high;
O make it now your chief-est care
The im-age of your Lord to bear.

Say, now, ye lovely social band,
Who walk the way to Canaan’s land,
Ye who have fled from Sodom’s plain,
Say, do you wish to turn again?
O have you ventured to the field,
Well armed with helmet, sword, and shield?
And shall the world, with dread alarms,
Compel you now to ground your arms?

Behold! I see, among the rest,
A host in richer garments dressed,
A host that near His presence stands,
And palms of vict’ry grace their hands.
Say, who are these I now behold,
With blood-washed robes and crowns of gold?
This glorious host is not unknown
To Him who sits upon the throne.

These are the foll’wers of the Lamb;
From tribulation great they came;
And on the hill of sweet repose
They bid adieu to all their woes.
Soon on the wings of love you’ll fly,
To join them in that world on high;
O make it now your chiefest care
The image of your Lord to bear.

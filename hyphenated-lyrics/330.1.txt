# FELLOWSHIP

Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Chris-tian love;
The fel-low-ship of kin-dred minds
Is like to that a-bove.

We share our mu-tual woes,
Our mu-tual bur-dens bear;
And of-ten for each oth-er flows
The sym-pa-thiz-ing tear.

When we a-sun-der part,
It gives us in-ward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet a-gain.

Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.

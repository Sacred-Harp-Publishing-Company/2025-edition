# THE DYING CHRISTIAN

Ye ob-jects of sense and en-joy-ments of time,
Which oft have de-light-ed my heart,
I soon shall ex-change you for views more sub-lime,
For joys that shall nev-er de-part.

Thou, Lord of the day, and thou, Queen of the night,
To me ye no long-er are known;
I soon shall be-hold, with in-creas-ing de-light,
A sun that shall nev-er go down.

Ye moun-tains and val-leys, groves, riv-ers and plains,
Thou earth and thou o-cean, a-dieu;
More per-ma-nent re-gions where right-eous-ness reigns
Pre-sent their bright hills to my view.

------

Ye objects of sense and enjoyments of time,
Which oft have delighted my heart,
I soon shall exchange you for views more sublime,
For joys that shall never depart.

Thou, Lord of the day, and thou, Queen of the night,
To me ye no longer are known;
I soon shall behold, with increasing delight,
A sun that shall never go down.

Ye mountains and valleys, groves, rivers and plains,
Thou earth and thou ocean, adieu;
More permanent regions where righteousness reigns
Present their bright hills to my view.

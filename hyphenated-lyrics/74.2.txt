# KING OF PEACE

Lord, I can-not let Thee go
Till a bless-ing Thou be-stow:
Do not turn a-way Thy face;
Mine’s an ur-gent, press-ing case.

Dost Thou ask me who I am?
Ah! my Lord, Thou know’st my name:
Yet the ques-tion gives a plea
To sup-port my suit with Thee.

Thou didst once a wretch be-hold,
In re-bel-lion blind-ly bold,
Scorn Thy grace, Thy pow’r de-fy;
That poor re-bel, Lord, was I.

Lord, I cannot let Thee go
Till a blessing Thou bestow:
Do not turn away Thy face;
Mine’s an urgent, pressing case.

Dost Thou ask me who I am?
Ah! my Lord, Thou know’st my name:
Yet the question gives a plea
To support my suit with Thee.

Thou didst once a wretch behold,
In rebellion blindly bold,
Scorn Thy grace, Thy pow’r defy;
That poor rebel, Lord, was I.

# POLAND

God of my life, look gen-tly down,
Be-hold the pains I feel;
But I am dumb be-fore Thy throne,
Nor dare dis-pute Thy will.

I’m but a so-journ-er be-low,
As all my fa-thers were;
May I be well pre-pared to go
When I the sum-mons hear.

But if my life be spared a-while,
Be-fore my last re-move,
Thy praise shall be my bus-’ness still
And I’ll de-clare Thy love.

God of my life, look gently down,
Behold the pains I feel;
But I am dumb before Thy throne,
Nor dare dispute Thy will.

I’m but a sojourner below,
As all my fathers were;
May I be well prepared to go
When I the summons hear.

But if my life be spared awhile,
Before my last remove,
Thy praise shall be my bus’ness still
And I’ll declare Thy love.

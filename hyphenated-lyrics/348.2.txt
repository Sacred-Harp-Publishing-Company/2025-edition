# FLEETING DAYS

Time! what an emp-ty va-por ’tis!
Our days, how swift they are,
Swift as an In-dian ar-row flies,
Or like a shoot-ing star.

Our life is ev-er on the wing,
And death is ev-er nigh;
The mo-ment when our lives be-gin
We all be-gin to die.

Time! what an empty vapor ’tis!
Our days, how swift they are,
Swift as an Indian arrow flies,
Or like a shooting star.

Our life is ever on the wing,
And death is ever nigh;
The moment when our lives begin
We all begin to die.

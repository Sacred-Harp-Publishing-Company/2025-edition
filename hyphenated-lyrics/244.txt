# PLEVNA

I sing the might-y pow’r of God,
That made the moun-tains rise,
That spread the flow-ing seas a-broad,
And built the loft-y skies.
I sing the wis-dom that or-dained
The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at His com-mand,
And all the stars o-bey.

I sing the good-ness of the Lord,
That filled the earth with food;
He formed the crea-tures with His word,
And then pro-nounced them good.
There’s not a plant or flow’r be-low
But makes Thy glo-ries known;
And clouds a-rise, and tem-pests blow,
By or-der from Thy throne.

I sing the mighty pow’r of God,
That made the mountains rise,
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
And built the lofty skies.
I sing the wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at His command,
And all the stars obey.

I sing the goodness of the Lord,
That filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures with His word,
And then pronounced them good.
There’s not a plant or flow’r below
But makes Thy glories known;
And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
By order from Thy throne.

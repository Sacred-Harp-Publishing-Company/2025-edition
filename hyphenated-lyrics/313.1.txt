# CONCORD

The men of grace have found
Glo-ry be-gun be-low;
Ce-les-tial fruits on earth-ly ground
From faith and hope may grow.

The hill of Zi-on yields
A thou-sand sa-cred sweets,
Be-fore we reach the heav’n-ly fields,
Or walk the gold-en streets.

Then let our songs a-bound,
And ev-’ry tear be dry;
We’re march-ing through Im-man-uel’s ground
To fair-er worlds on high.

The men of grace have found
Glory begun below;
Celestial fruits on earthly ground
From faith and hope may grow.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound,
And ev’ry tear be dry;
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground
To fairer worlds on high.

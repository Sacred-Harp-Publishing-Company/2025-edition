# DELIGHT

No burn-ing heats by day,
Nor blasts of eve-ning air,
Shall take my health a-way,
If God be with me there.
Thou art my sun and Thou my shade,
To guard my head by night or noon.

No burning heats by day,
Nor blasts of evening air,
Shall take my health away,
If God be with me there.
Thou art my sun and Thou my shade,
To guard my head by night or noon.

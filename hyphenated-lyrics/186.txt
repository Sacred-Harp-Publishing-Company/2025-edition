# SHERBURNE

While shep-herds watched their flocks by night,
All seat-ed on the ground,
The an-gel of the Lord came down,
And glo-ry shone a-round.

All glo-ry be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good will hence-forth from heav’n to men
Be-gin and nev-er cease.

While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around.

All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good will henceforth from heav’n to men
Begin and never cease.

Lord, we come be-fore Thee now;
At Thy feet we hum-bly bow;
O do not our suit dis-dain!
Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain?

Lord, on Thee our souls de-pend;
In com-pas-sion now de-scend;
Fill our hearts with Thy rich grace;
Tune our lips to sing Thy praise.

In Thine own ap-point-ed way,
Now we seek Thee, here we stay;
Lord, we know not how to go,
Till a bless-ing Thou be-stow.

Send some mes-sage from Thy word
That may joy and peace af-ford;
Let Thy Spir-it now im-part
Full sal-va-tion to each heart.

Com-fort those who weep and mourn;
Let the time of joy re-turn;
Those who are cast down lift up,
Strong in faith, in love, and hope.

Grant that all may seek and find
Thee a God su-preme-ly kind;
Heal the sick, the cap-tive free;
Let us all re-joice in Thee.

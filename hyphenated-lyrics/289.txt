# GREENSBOROUGH

There is a land of pure de-light
Where saints im-mor-tal reign;
In-fi-nite day ex-cludes the night,
And pleas-ures ban-ish pain.

There ev-er-last-ing spring a-bides,
And nev-er-with-’ring flow’rs;
Death, like a nar-row sea, di-vides
This heav’n-ly land from ours.

Sweet fields be-yond the swell-ing flood
Stand dressed in liv-ing green;
So to the Jews old Ca-naan stood,
While Jor-dan rolled be-tween.

But tim-’rous mor-tals start and shrink
To cross this nar-row sea,
And lin-ger, shiv-’ring on the brink,
And fear to launch a-way.

Oh, could we make our doubts re-move,
Those gloom-y doubts that rise,
And see the Ca-naan that we love
With un-be-cloud-ed eyes.

Could we but climb where Mo-ses stood
And view the land-scape o’er,
Not Jor-dan’s stream nor death’s cold flood
Should fright us from the shore.

There is a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.

There everlasting spring abides,
And never-with’ring flow’rs;
Death, like a narrow sea, divides
This heav’nly land from ours.

Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
Stand dressed in living green;
So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between.

But tim’rous mortals start and shrink
To cross this narrow sea,
And linger, shiv’ring on the brink,
And fear to launch away.

Oh, could we make our doubts remove,
Those gloomy doubts that rise,
And see the Canaan that we love
With unbeclouded eyes.

Could we but climb where Moses stood
And view the landscape o’er,
Not Jordan’s stream nor death’s cold flood
Should fright us from the shore.

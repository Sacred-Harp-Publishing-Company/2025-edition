# MY HOME

We are told there is a home
In a land be-yond the sky;
I hope to reach that hap-py place
Where the soul shall nev-er die.
And when my bless-ed Sav-ior bids me come,
Then I shall live in heav’n a-bove,
And see my Sav-ior’s face;
I’ll thank Him for His Son,
And praise Him for His sav-ing grace
And won-ders of His love.

We are told there is a home
In a land beyond the sky;
I hope to reach that happy place
Where the soul shall never die.
And when my blessed Savior bids me come,
Then I shall live in heav’n above,
And see my Savior’s face;
I’ll thank Him for His Son,
And praise Him for His saving grace
And wonders of His love.

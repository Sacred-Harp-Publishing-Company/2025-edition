# HE HATH SAVED US

Je-sus is our great sal-va-tion,
Wor-thy of our best es-teem;
He has saved this con-gre-ga-tion;
Join to sing a-loud to Him:

[chorus]
He hath saved us, He hath saved us,
Christ a-lone could us re-deem.

Let us nev-er, Lord, for-get Thee;
Make us walk as pil-grims here;
We will give Thee all the glo-ry
Of the love that brought us near:

Jesus is our great salvation,
Worthy of our best esteem;
He has saved this congregation;
Join to sing aloud to Him:

[chorus]
He hath saved us, He hath saved us,
Christ alone could us redeem.

Let us never, Lord, forget Thee;
Make us walk as pilgrims here;
We will give Thee all the glory
Of the love that brought us near:

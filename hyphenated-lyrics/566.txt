# GUM POND

Lord, Thou hast searched and seen me through;
Thine eye com-mands, with pierc-ing view,
My ris-ing and my rest-ing hours,
My heart and flesh with all their pow’rs.

My thoughts, be-fore they are my own,
Are to my God dis-tinct-ly known;
He knows the words I mean to speak
Ere from the op-’ning lips they break.

If I should try to shun Thy sight
Be-neath the spread-ing veil of night,
One glance of Thine, one pierc-ing ray,
Would kin-dle dark-ness in-to day.

Beneath the spreading veil of night,
One glance of Thine, one piercing ray,
Would kindle darkness into day.

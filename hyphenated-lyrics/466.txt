A throne of grace, then let us go
And of-fer up our prayer;
A gra-cious God will mer-cy show
To all that wor-ship there.
A throne of grace, oh, at that throne
Our knees have of-ten bent,
And God has showered His bless-ing down
As oft, as of-ten as we went.

A throne of grace, then let us go
And offer up our prayer;
A gracious God will mercy show
To all that worship there.
A throne of grace, oh, at that throne
Our knees have often bent,
And God has showered His blessing down
As oft, as often as we went.

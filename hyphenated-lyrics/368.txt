# STONY POINT

A few more days on earth to spend,
And all my toils and cares shall end,
And I shall see my God and friend,
And praise His name on high.
No more to sigh or shed a tear,
No more to suf-fer pain or fear,
But God and Christ and heav’n ap-pear
Un-to the rap-tured eye.

No more to suffer pain or fear,

Unto the raptured eye.

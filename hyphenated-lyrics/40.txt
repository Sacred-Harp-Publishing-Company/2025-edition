Blow ye the trum-pet, blow,
The glad-ly sol-emn sound;
Let all the na-tions know
To earth’s re-mot-est bound:

[chorus]
The year of ju-bi-lee is come;
Re-turn, ye ran-somed sin-ners, home.

Ex-tol the Lamb of God,
The all-a-ton-ing Lamb;
Re-demp-tion through His blood
Through-out the world pro-claim;

The Gos-pel trum-pet hear,
The news of heav’n-ly grace;
And saved from earth, ap-pear
Be-fore your Sav-ior’s face;

------

Blow ye the trumpet, blow,
The gladly solemn sound;
Let all the nations know
To earth’s remotest bound:

[chorus]
The year of jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.

Extol the Lamb of God,
The all-atoning Lamb;
Redemption through His blood
Throughout the world proclaim;

The Gospel trumpet hear,
The news of heav’nly grace;
And saved from earth, appear
Before your Savior’s face;

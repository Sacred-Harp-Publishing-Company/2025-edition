# PRESENT JOYS

We thank the Lord of heav’n and earth,
Who hath pre-served us from our birth,

[chorus]
For pres-ent joys, for bless-ings past,
And for the hope of heav’n at last.

How shall we half our task ful-fill?
We thank Thee for Thy mind and will,

Re-deemed us oft from death and dread,
And with Thy gifts our ta-ble spread,

# FROZEN HEART

Lord, shed a beam of heav’n-ly day
To melt this stub-born stone a-way,
And thaw with rays of love di-vine
This heart, this fro-zen heart of mine.

To hear the sor-rows Thou hast felt
All but an ad-a-mant would melt;
Good-ness and wrath in vain com-bine
To move this stu-pid heart of mine.

But One can yet per-form the deed;
That One in all His grace I need;
Thy Spir-it can from dross re-fine
And melt this stub-born heart of mine.

O Breath of Life, breathe on my soul!
On me let streams of mer-cy roll;
Now thaw with rays of love di-vine
This heart, this fro-zen heart of mine.

Lord, shed a beam of heav’nly day
To melt this stubborn stone away,
And thaw with rays of love divine
This heart, this frozen heart of mine.

To hear the sorrows Thou hast felt
All but an adamant would melt;
Goodness and wrath in vain combine
To move this stupid heart of mine.

But One can yet perform the deed;
That One in all His grace I need;
Thy Spirit can from dross refine
And melt this stubborn heart of mine.

O Breath of Life, breathe on my soul!
On me let streams of mercy roll;
Now thaw with rays of love divine
This heart, this frozen heart of mine.

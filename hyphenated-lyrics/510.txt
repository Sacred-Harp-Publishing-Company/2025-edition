Ho-ly Spir-it, faith-ful guide,
Ev-er near the Chris-tian’s side;
Gen-tly lead us by the hand,
Pil-grims in a bar-ren land;

[chorus]
Wea-ry souls for-e’er re-joice
While they hear that sweet-est voice
Whis-per soft-ly,
“Fol-low me, I’ll guide thee home.”

Ev-er pres-ent, tru-est friend,
Ev-er near Thine aid to lend,
Leave us not to doubt and fear,
Grop-ing on in dark-ness drear;

Holy Spirit, faithful guide,
Ever near the Christian’s side;
Gently lead us by the hand,
Pilgrims in a barren land;

[chorus]
Weary souls fore’er rejoice
While they hear that sweetest voice
Whisper softly,
“Follow me, I’ll guide thee home.”

Ever present, truest friend,
Ever near Thine aid to lend,
Leave us not to doubt and fear,
Groping on in darkness drear;

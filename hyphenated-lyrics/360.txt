# THE ROYAL BAND

Ho-san-na to Je-sus! my soul’s filled with prais-es,
Come, O my dear breth-ren, and help me to sing;
No mu-sic so charm-ing, no look is so warm-ing,
It gives life and com-fort and glad-ness with-in.
Ho-san-na is ring-ing: O how I love sing-ing,
There’s noth-ing so sweet as the sound of His name;
The an-gels in glo-ry re-peat the glad sto-ry
Of love which in Je-sus is made known to man.

Ho-san-na to Je-sus! my soul how it pleas-es
To see sin-ners fall-ing and cry-ing to God;
Then shout-ing and prais-ing, they cry, “’Tis a-maz-ing;
We’ve found peace and par-don in Je-sus-’s blood!”
Ho-san-na is ring-ing, hark, how they are sing-ing,
“All glo-ry to Je-sus, we’ve tast-ed His love!”
The king-dom of heav-en to mor-tals is giv-en,
And rolls through my soul from the man-sions a-bove.

Hosanna to Jesus! my soul’s filled with praises,
Come, O my dear brethren, and help me to sing;
No music so charming, no look is so warming,
It gives life and comfort and gladness within.
Hosanna is ringing: O how I love singing,
There’s nothing so sweet as the sound of His name;
The angels in glory repeat the glad story
Of love which in Jesus is made known to man.

Hosanna to Jesus! my soul how it pleases
To see sinners falling and crying to God;
Then shouting and praising, they cry, “’Tis amazing;
We’ve found peace and pardon in Jesus’s blood!”
Hosanna is ringing, hark, how they are singing,
“All glory to Jesus, we’ve tasted His love!”
The kingdom of heaven to mortals is given,
And rolls through my soul from the mansions above.

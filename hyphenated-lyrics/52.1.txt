Come, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet ac-cord,
While ye sur-round His throne.

Let those re-fuse to sing
Who nev-er knew our God,
But ser-vants of the heav’n-ly King
May speak their joys a-broad.

The men of grace have found
Glo-ry be-gun be-low;
Ce-les-tial fruits on earth-ly ground
From faith and hope may grow.

Come, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
While ye surround His throne.

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God,
But servants of the heav’nly King
May speak their joys abroad.

The men of grace have found
Glory begun below;
Celestial fruits on earthly ground
From faith and hope may grow.

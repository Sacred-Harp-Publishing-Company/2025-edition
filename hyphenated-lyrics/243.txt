# STANTON

Broth-er, rest from sin and sor-row!
Death is o’er, and life is won;
On thy slum-ber dawns no mor-row;
Rest! thine earth-ly race is run.

[chorus]
Hark! the gold-en harps are ring-ing;
Sounds an-gel-ic fill the air;
Mil-lions now in heav-en sing-ing
Greet our joy-ful en-trance there.

Broth-er, wake! the night is wan-ing;
End-less day is round thee poured;
En-ter thou the rest re-main-ing
For the peo-ple of the Lord.

------

Brother, rest from sin and sorrow!
Death is o’er, and life is won;
On thy slumber dawns no morrow;
Rest! thine earthly race is run.

[chorus]
Hark! the golden harps are ringing;
Sounds angelic fill the air;
Millions now in heaven singing
Greet our joyful entrance there.

Brother, wake! the night is waning;
Endless day is round thee poured;
Enter thou the rest remaining
For the people of the Lord.

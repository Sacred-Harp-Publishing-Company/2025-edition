# BEACH SPRING

Come, ye sin-ners, poor and need-y,
Weak and wound-ed, sick and sore;
Je-sus read-y stands to save you,
Full of pit-y, love and pow’r.
He is a-ble, He is a-ble,
He is will-ing, doubt no more.

Let not con-science make you lin-ger,
Nor of fit-ness fond-ly dream;
All the fit-ness He re-quir-eth
Is to feel your need of Him.
This He gives you, this He gives you;
’Tis the Spi-rit’s ris-ing beam.

Ag-o-niz-ing in the gar-den,
Lo! your Mas-ter pros-trate lies;
On the blood-y tree be-hold Him;
Hear Him cry be-fore He dies:
“It is fin-ished; it is fin-ished!”
Sin-ners, will not this suf-fice?

Lo! th’in-car-nate God as-cend-ed
Pleads the mer-it of His blood;
Ven-ture to Him, ven-ture whol-ly;
Let no oth-er trust in-trude.
None but Je-sus, none but Je-sus
Can do help-less sin-ners good.

Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,
Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
Jesus ready stands to save you,
Full of pity, love and pow’r.
He is able, He is able,
He is willing, doubt no more.

Let not conscience make you linger,
Nor of fitness fondly dream;
All the fitness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him.
This He gives you, this He gives you;
’Tis the Spirit’s rising beam.

Agonizing in the garden,
Lo! your Master prostrate lies;
On the bloody tree behold Him;
Hear Him cry before He dies:
“It is finished; it is finished!”
Sinners, will not this suffice?

Lo! th’incarnate God ascended
Pleads the merit of His blood;
Venture to Him, venture wholly;
Let no other trust intrude.
None but Jesus, none but Jesus
Can do helpless sinners good.

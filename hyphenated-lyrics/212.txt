How pleas-ant ’tis to see
Kin-dred and friends a-gree,
Each in his prop-er sta-tion move,
And each ful-fill his part
With sym-pa-thiz-ing heart,
In all the cares of life and love.

How pleasant ’tis to see
Kindred and friends agree,
Each in his proper station move,
And each fulfill his part
With sympathizing heart,
In all the cares of life and love.

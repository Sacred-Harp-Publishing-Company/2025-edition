# THE ENQUIRER

I’m not a-shamed to own my Lord,
Or to de-fend His cause,
Main-tain the hon-or of His word,
The glo-ry of His cross.
Je-sus, my God, I know His name;
His name is all my trust,
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne His prom-ise stands,
And He can well se-cure
What I’ve com-mit-ted to His hands
Till the de-ci-sive hour.
Then will He own my worth-less name
Be-fore His Fa-ther’s face,
And in the new Je-ru-sa-lem
Ap-point my soul a place.

I’m not ashamed to own my Lord,
Or to defend His cause,
Maintain the honor of His word,
The glory of His cross.
Jesus, my God, I know His name;
His name is all my trust,
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne His promise stands,
And He can well secure
What I’ve committed to His hands
Till the decisive hour.
Then will He own my worthless name
Before His Father’s face,
And in the new Jerusalem
Appoint my soul a place.

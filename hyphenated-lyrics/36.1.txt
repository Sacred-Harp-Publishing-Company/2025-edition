My soul, re-peat His praise,
Whose mer-cies are so great,
Whose an-ger is so slow to rise,
So read-y to a-bate.

His pow’r sub-dues our sins,
And His for-giv-ing love,
Far as the east is from the west,
Doth all our guilt re-move.

My soul, repeat His praise,
Whose mercies are so great,
Whose anger is so slow to rise,
So ready to abate.

His pow’r subdues our sins,
And His forgiving love,
Far as the east is from the west,
Doth all our guilt remove.

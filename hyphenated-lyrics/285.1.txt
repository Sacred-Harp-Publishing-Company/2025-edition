Come, let us join our friends a-bove
That have ob-tained the prize,
And on the ea-gle wings of love
To joy ce-les-tial rise.
Let all the saints ter-res-trial sing
With those to glo-ry gone,
For all the ser-vants of our King
In heav’n and earth are one.

One fam-i-ly, we dwell in Him,
One church a-bove, be-neath,
Though now di-vid-ed by the stream,
The nar-row stream of death.
One ar-my of the liv-ing God,
To His com-mand we bow;
Part of the host have crossed the flood,
And part are cross-ing now.

Come, let us join our friends above
That have obtained the prize,
And on the eagle wings of love
To joy celestial rise.
Let all the saints terrestrial sing
With those to glory gone,
For all the servants of our King
In heav’n and earth are one.

One family, we dwell in Him,
One church above, beneath,
Though now divided by the stream,
The narrow stream of death.
One army of the living God,
To His command we bow;
Part of the host have crossed the flood,
And part are crossing now.

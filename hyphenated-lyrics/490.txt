# MY SHEPHERD GUIDES

The Lord my pre-cious Shep-herd is,
He guides me day by day;
If I but trust His ho-ly word,
In paths of right I’ll stay.
I’ll fear no e-vil if He leads,
Be-side the wa-ters still;
He a-noints my head with oil so sweet,
My cup with joy He fills.

Though I walk through the val-ley dark,
No shad-ows will be-fall;
Thy rod, Thy staff, they com-fort me;
Thou art my God, my all.
Sure-ly Thy good-ness and Thy love,
Thy mer-cy free on call,
Will keep me safe from sin and strife;
I’ll praise Thee, Lord of all.

The Lord my precious Shepherd is,
He guides me day by day;
If I but trust His holy word,
In paths of right I’ll stay.
I’ll fear no evil if He leads,
Beside the waters still;
He anoints my head with oil so sweet,
My cup with joy He fills.

Though I walk through the valley dark,
No shadows will befall;
Thy rod, Thy staff, they comfort me;
Thou art my God, my all.
Surely Thy goodness and Thy love,
Thy mercy free on call,
Will keep me safe from sin and strife;
I’ll praise Thee, Lord of all.

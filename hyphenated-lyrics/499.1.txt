# PASTURES GREEN

My Shep-herd will sup-ply my need,
Je-ho-vah is His name;
In pas-tures green He leads me on,
Be-side the liv-ing stream.

With lov-ing-kind-ness Thou hast drawn
My wan-d’ring heart to Thee.
With kind com-pas-sion send me on,
To all e-ter-ni-ty.

My Shepherd will supply my need,
Jehovah is His name;
In pastures green He leads me on,
Beside the living stream.

With loving-kindness Thou hast drawn
My wand’ring heart to Thee.
With kind compassion send me on,
To all eternity.

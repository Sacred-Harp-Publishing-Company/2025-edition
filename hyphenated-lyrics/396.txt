# NOTES ALMOST DIVINE

Oh, could I speak the match-less worth,
Oh, could I sound the glo-ries forth,
Which in my Sav-ior shine,
I’d soar and touch the heav’n-ly strings,
And vie with Ga-briel while he sings
In notes al-most di-vine.

Well, the de-light-ful day will come
When my dear Lord will take me home,
And I shall see His face;
Then with my Sav-ior, Broth-er, Friend,
A blest e-ter-ni-ty I’ll spend,
Tri-um-phant in His grace.

Oh, could I speak the matchless worth,
Oh, could I sound the glories forth,
Which in my Savior shine,
I’d soar and touch the heav’nly strings,
And vie with Gabriel while he sings
In notes almost divine.

Well, the delightful day will come
When my dear Lord will take me home,
And I shall see His face;
Then with my Savior, Brother, Friend,
A blest eternity I’ll spend,
Triumphant in His grace.

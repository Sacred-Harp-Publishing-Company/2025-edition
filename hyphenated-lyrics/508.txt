# SERMON ON THE MOUNT

And see-ing, and see-ing the mul-ti-tudes, He went
Up in-to a mount; and when He was set, His dis-ci-ples came un-to Him.
He o-pened His mouth; there bless-ings poured out to the chil-dren a-bout, and none were left out.
Bless-ed are the pure in heart, for they shall see the king-dom of heav’n.
The meek He blessed with right-eous-ness; the weak, the dumb, the blind ones too, will sing to His praise when we all reach home.

And seeing, and seeing the multitudes, He went
Up into a mount; and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him.
He opened His mouth; there blessings poured out to the children about, and none were left out.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see the kingdom of heav’n.
The meek He blessed with righteousness; the weak, the dumb, the blind ones too, will sing to His praise when we all reach home.

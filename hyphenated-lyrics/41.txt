# EVENING HYMN

The day is past and gone,
The eve-ning shades ap-pear;
O may we all re-mem-ber well
The night of death draws near.

Lord, keep us safe this night,
Se-cure from all our fears;
May an-gels guard us while we sleep,
Till morn-ing light ap-pears.

The day is past and gone,
The evening shades appear;
O may we all remember well
The night of death draws near.

Lord, keep us safe this night,
Secure from all our fears;
May angels guard us while we sleep,
Till morning light appears.

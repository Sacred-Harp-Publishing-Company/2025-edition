# MUTUAL LOVE

O when shall I see Je-sus,
And reign with Him a-bove?
And from the flow-ing foun-tain
Drink ev-er-last-ing love?
When shall I be de-liv-ered
From this vain world of sin?
And with my bless-ed Je-sus
Drink end-less pleas-ures in?

But now I am a sol-dier,
My Cap-tain’s gone be-fore;
He’s giv-en me my or-ders,
And bids me ne’er give o’er.
His prom-is-es are faith-ful—
A right-eous crown He’ll give,
And all His val-iant sol-diers
E-ter-nal-ly shall live.

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above?
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love?
When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin?
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in?

But now I am a soldier,
My Captain’s gone before;
He’s given me my orders,
And bids me ne’er give o’er.
His promises are faithful—
A righteous crown He’ll give,
And all His valiant soldiers
Eternally shall live.

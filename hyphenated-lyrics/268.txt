# DAVIDâ€™S LAMENTATION

Da-vid, the king, was griev-ed and mov-ed;
He went to his cham-ber, his cham-ber and wept.
And as he went, he wept and said,
O my son! O my son!
Would to God I had died for thee, O Ab-sa-lom, my son, my son!

David, the king, was grieved and moved;
He went to his chamber, his chamber and wept.
And as he went, he wept and said,
O my son! O my son!
Would to God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

# SACRED MOUNT

Sing, O ye ran-somed of the Lord,
Your great Re-deem-er sing.

[chorus]
Pil-grims for Zi-on’s cit-y bound,
Be joy-ful in your King;
A hand di-vine shall lead you on,
Through all the bliss-ful road,
Till to the sa-cred mount you rise,
And see your smil-ing God.

March on in your Re-deem-er’s strength,
Pur-sue His foot-steps still.

------

Sing, O ye ransomed of the Lord,
Your great Redeemer sing.

[chorus]
Pilgrims for Zion’s city bound,
Be joyful in your King;
A hand divine shall lead you on,
Through all the blissful road,
Till to the sacred mount you rise,
And see your smiling God.

March on in your Redeemer’s strength,
Pursue His footsteps still.

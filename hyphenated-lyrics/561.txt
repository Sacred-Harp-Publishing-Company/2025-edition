# CUNNINGHAM

Gen-tly, Lord, O gen-tly lead us
Through this gloom-y vale of tears,
Through the chang-es Thou’st de-creed us,
Till our last great change ap-pears.

[chorus]
O re-fresh us with Thy bless-ing,
O re-fresh us with Thy grace;
May Thy mer-cies, nev-er ceas-ing,
Fit us for Thy dwell-ing place.

When temp-ta-tion’s darts as-sail us,
When in de-vious paths we stray,
Let Thy good-ness nev-er fail us,
Lead us in Thy per-fect way.

------

Gently, Lord, O gently lead us
Through this gloomy vale of tears,
Through the changes Thou’st decreed us,
Till our last great change appears.

[chorus]
O refresh us with Thy blessing,
O refresh us with Thy grace;
May Thy mercies, never ceasing,
Fit us for Thy dwelling place.

When temptation’s darts assail us,
When in devious paths we stray,
Let Thy goodness never fail us,
Lead us in Thy perfect way.

# DULL CARE

Why should we at our lot com-plain,
Or grieve at our dis-tress?
Some think if they could rich-es gain,
They’d gain true hap-pi-ness.
Ah! we’re much to blame,
We’re all the same—
A-like we’re made of clay;
Then, since we have a Sav-ior dear,
Let’s drive all cares a-way.

Why should the rich de-spise the poor?
Why should the poor re-pine?
A lit-tle time will make us all
In e-qual friend-ship join.
Ah! we’re much to blame,
We’re all the same—
A-like we’re made of clay;
Then, since we have a Sav-ior dear,
Let’s drive all cares a-way.

The on-ly cir-cum-stance of life
That ev-er I could find
To soft-en cares and tem-per strife
Was a con-tent-ed mind;
When we’ve this in store,
We have much more
Than wealth could e’er con-vey;
Then, since we have a Sav-ior dear,
Let’s drive all cares a-way.

When age, old creep-ing age comes on,
And we are young no more,
Let’s all re-pent the sins we’ve done,
Nor grieve that youth is o’er;
We’ll more faith-ful be
Than for-mer-ly,
And con-stant-ly to pray;
Then, since we have a Sav-ior dear,
Let’s drive all cares a-way.

Why should we at our lot complain,
Or grieve at our distress?
Some think if they could riches gain,
They’d gain true happiness.
Ah! we’re much to blame,
We’re all the same—
Alike we’re made of clay;
Then, since we have a Savior dear,
Let’s drive all cares away.

Why should the rich despise the poor?
Why should the poor repine?
A little time will make us all
In equal friendship join.
Ah! we’re much to blame,
We’re all the same—
Alike we’re made of clay;
Then, since we have a Savior dear,
Let’s drive all cares away.

The only circumstance of life
That ever I could find
To soften cares and temper strife
Was a contented mind;
When we’ve this in store,
We have much more
Than wealth could e’er convey;
Then, since we have a Savior dear,
Let’s drive all cares away.

When age, old creeping age comes on,
And we are young no more,
Let’s all repent the sins we’ve done,
Nor grieve that youth is o’er;
We’ll more faithful be
Than formerly,
And constantly to pray;
Then, since we have a Savior dear,
Let’s drive all cares away.

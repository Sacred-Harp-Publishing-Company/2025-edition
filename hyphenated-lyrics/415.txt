# ENDLESS PRAISE

When we’ve been there ten thou-sand years
Bright shin-ing as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first be-gun.

There shall we join, and nev-er tire,
To sing im-mor-tal lays,
And, with the bright se-raph-ic choir,
Sound forth Im-man-uel’s praise.

When we’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.

There shall we join, and never tire,
To sing immortal lays,
And, with the bright seraphic choir,
Sound forth Immanuel’s praise.

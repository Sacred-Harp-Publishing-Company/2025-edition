Day of judg-ment, day of won-ders!
Hark! the trum-pet’s aw-ful sound,
Loud-er than a thou-sand thun-ders,
Shakes the vast cre-a-tion round!
How the sum-mons
Will the sin-ner’s heart con-found.

At His call the dead a-wak-en,
Rise to life from earth and sea;
All the pow’rs of na-ture shak-en
By His looks pre-pare to flee:
Care-less sin-ner!
What will then be-come of thee?

------

Day of judgment, day of wonders!
Hark! the trumpet’s awful sound,
Louder than a thousand thunders,
Shakes the vast creation round!
How the summons
Will the sinner’s heart confound.

At His call the dead awaken,
Rise to life from earth and sea;
All the pow’rs of nature shaken
By His looks prepare to flee:
Careless sinner!
What will then become of thee?

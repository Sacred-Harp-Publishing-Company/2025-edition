Come, Thou Fount of ev-’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mer-cy, nev-er ceas-ing,
Call for songs of loud-est praise.

[chorus]
I am bound for the king-dom,
Will you go to glo-ry with me?
Hal-le-lu-jah, praise the Lord.

Oh, to grace how great a debt-or
Dai-ly I’m con-strained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fet-ter,
Bind my wan-d’ring heart to Thee.

Prone to wan-der, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, Lord, take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts a-bove.

Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

[chorus]
I am bound for the kingdom,
Will you go to glory with me?
Hallelujah, praise the Lord.

Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, Lord, take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.

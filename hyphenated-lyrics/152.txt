# SHEPHERDS REJOICE

Shep-herds, re-joice! lift up your eyes,
And send your fears a-way:
News from the re-gions of the skies—
A Sav-ior’s born to-day!
Je-sus, the God whom an-gels fear,
Comes down to dwell with you;
To-day He makes His en-trance here,
But not as mon-archs do.

No gold, nor pur-ple swad-dling bands,
Nor roy-al shin-ing things:
A man-ger for His cra-dle stands,
And holds the King of kings.
Go, shep-herds, where the in-fant lies,
And see His hum-ble throne;
The tears of joy in all your eyes,
Go, shep-herds, kiss the Son.

Thus Ga-briel sang and straight a-round
The heav’n-ly ar-mies throng;
They tune their harps to soft-ly sound,
And thus con-clude their song:
Glo-ry to God who reigns a-bove,
Let peace sur-round the earth;
Mor-tals shall know their Mak-er’s love
At their Re-deem-er’s birth.

Shepherds, rejoice! lift up your eyes,
And send your fears away:
News from the regions of the skies—
A Savior’s born today!
Jesus, the God whom angels fear,
Comes down to dwell with you;
Today He makes His entrance here,
But not as monarchs do.

No gold, nor purple swaddling bands,
Nor royal shining things:
A manger for His cradle stands,
And holds the King of kings.
Go, shepherds, where the infant lies,
And see His humble throne;
The tears of joy in all your eyes,
Go, shepherds, kiss the Son.

Thus Gabriel sang and straight around
The heav’nly armies throng;
They tune their harps to softly sound,
And thus conclude their song:
Glory to God who reigns above,
Let peace surround the earth;
Mortals shall know their Maker’s love
At their Redeemer’s birth.

# CARNSVILLE

I love my bless-ed Sav-ior,
I feel I’m in His fa-vor,
And I am His for-ev-er,
If I but faith-ful prove;
And now I’m bound for Ca-naan,
I feel my sins for-giv-en,
And soon shall get to heav-en
To sing re-deem-ing love.

Poor sin-ners may de-ride me,
And un-be-liev-ers chide me,
But noth-ing shall di-vide me
From Je-sus, my best friend;
Sup-port-ed by His pow-er,
I long to see the hour
That bids my spir-it tow-er,
And all my trou-bles end.

The pleas-ing time is hast-’ning,
My tot-t’ring frame is wast-ing,
While I’m en-gaged in prais-ing,
Im-pell-ed by His love,
When yon-der shin-ing or-ders,
Who sing on Ca-naan’s bor-ders,
Shall bear me to the Lord there,
To praise His name a-bove.

I love my blessed Savior,
I feel I’m in His favor,
And I am His forever,
If I but faithful prove;
And now I’m bound for Canaan,
I feel my sins forgiven,
And soon shall get to heaven
To sing redeeming love.

Poor sinners may deride me,
And unbelievers chide me,
But nothing shall divide me
From Jesus, my best friend;
Supported by His power,
I long to see the hour
That bids my spirit tower,
And all my troubles end.

The pleasing time is hast’ning,
My tott’ring frame is wasting,
While I’m engaged in praising,
Impelled by His love,
When yonder shining orders,
Who sing on Canaan’s borders,
Shall bear me to the Lord there,
To praise His name above.

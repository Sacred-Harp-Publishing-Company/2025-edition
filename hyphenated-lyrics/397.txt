# THE FOUNTAIN

There is a foun-tain filled with blood,
Drawn from Im-man-uel’s veins;
And sin-ners plunged be-neath that flood
Lose all their guilt-y stains.
The dy-ing thief re-joiced to see
That foun-tain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins a-way.

E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flow-ing wounds sup-ply,
Re-deem-ing love has been my theme
And shall be till I die.
Then in a no-bler, sweet-er song,
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save;
When this poor lisp-ing, stam-m’ring tongue
Lies si-lent in the grave.

There is a fountain filled with blood,
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains.
The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die.
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save;
When this poor lisping, stamm’ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave.

# THE GRIEVED SOUL

Come, my soul, and let us try
For a lit-tle sea-son,
Ev-’ry bur-den to lay by,
Come and let us rea-son.
What is this that casts thee down?
Who are those that grieve thee?
Speak and let the worst be known;
Speak-ing may re-lieve thee.

Come, my soul, and let us try
For a little season,
Ev’ry burden to lay by,
Come and let us reason.
What is this that casts thee down?
Who are those that grieve thee?
Speak and let the worst be known;
Speaking may relieve thee.

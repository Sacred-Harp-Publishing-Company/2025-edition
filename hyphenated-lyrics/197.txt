The cross of Christ in-spires my heart
To sing re-deem-ing grace;
A-wake, my soul, and bear a part
In my Re-deem-er’s praise.
Oh, who can be com-pared to Him
Who died up-on the tree?
This is my dear de-light-ful theme,
That Je-sus died for me.

The cross of Christ inspires my heart
To sing redeeming grace;
Awake, my soul, and bear a part
In my Redeemer’s praise.
Oh, who can be compared to Him
Who died upon the tree?
This is my dear delightful theme,
That Jesus died for me.

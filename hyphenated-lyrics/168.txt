# COWPER

For-give the song that falls so low
Be-neath the grat-i-tude I owe;
It means Thy praise, how-ev-er poor,
An an-gel’s song can do no more.

Great God, and wilt Thou con-de-scend
To be my Fa-ther and my Friend?
I a poor child, and Thou so high,
The Lord of earth and air and sky!

Forgive the song that falls so low
Beneath the gratitude I owe;
It means Thy praise, however poor,
An angel’s song can do no more.

Great God, and wilt Thou condescend
To be my Father and my Friend?
I a poor child, and Thou so high,
The Lord of earth and air and sky!

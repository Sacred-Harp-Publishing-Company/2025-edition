Vi-tal spark of heav’n-ly flame,
Quit, oh, quit this mor-tal frame!
Trem-bling, hop-ing, lin-g’ring, fly-ing,
Oh, the pain, the bliss of dy-ing!
Cease, fond na-ture, cease thy strife,
And let me lan-guish in-to life.

Hark! they whis-per; an-gels say,
Sis-ter spir-it, come a-way.
What is this ab-sorbs me quite,
Steals my sens-es, shuts my sight,
Drowns my spir-it, draws my breath?
Tell me, my soul, can this be death?

The world re-cedes; it dis-ap-pears;
Heav’n o-pens on my eyes; my ears
With sounds se-raph-ic ring.
Lend, lend your wings! I mount! I fly!
O grave, where is thy vic-to-ry?
O death, where is thy sting?

Vital spark of heav’nly flame,
Quit, oh, quit this mortal frame!
Trembling, hoping, ling’ring, flying,
Oh, the pain, the bliss of dying!
Cease, fond nature, cease thy strife,
And let me languish into life.

Hark! they whisper; angels say,
Sister spirit, come away.
What is this absorbs me quite,
Steals my senses, shuts my sight,
Drowns my spirit, draws my breath?
Tell me, my soul, can this be death?

The world recedes; it disappears;
Heav’n opens on my eyes; my ears
With sounds seraphic ring.
Lend, lend your wings! I mount! I fly!
O grave, where is thy victory?
O death, where is thy sting?

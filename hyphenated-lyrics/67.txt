# COLUMBUS

Oh, once I had a glo-rious view
Of my re-deem-ing Lord;
He said, “I’ll be a God to you,”
And I be-lieved His word.
But now I have a deep-er stroke
Than all my groan-ings are;
My God has me of late for-sook;
He’s gone, I know not where.

Oh, what im-mor-tal joys I felt
On that ce-les-tial day,
When my hard heart be-gan to melt,
By love dis-solved a-way!
But my com-plaint is bit-ter now,
For all my joys are gone;
I’ve strayed! I’m left! I know not how;
The light’s from me with-drawn.

Once I could joy the saints to meet,
To me they were most dear;
I then could stoop to wash their feet,
And shed a joy-ful tear;
But now I meet them as the rest,
And with them joy-less stay;
My con-ver-sa-tion’s spir-it-less,
Or else I’ve naught to say.

I once could mourn o’er dy-ing men,
And longed their souls to win;
I tra-vailed for their poor chil-dren,
And warned them of their sin;
But now my heart’s so care-less grown,
Al-though they’re drowned in vice;
My bow-els o’er them cease to yearn—
My tears have left mine eyes.

I for-ward go in du-ty’s way,
But can’t per-ceive Him there;
Then back-ward on the road I stray,
But can-not find Him there;
On the left hand, where He doth work,
A-mong the wick-ed crew,
And on the right I find Him not
A-mong the fa-vored few.

What shall I do? shall I lie down
And sink in deep de-spair?
Will He for-ev-er wear a frown,
Nor hear my fee-ble prayer?
No, He will put His strength in me,
He knows the way I’ve strolled,
And when I’m tried suf-fi-cient-ly
I shall come forth as gold.

Oh, once I had a glorious view
Of my redeeming Lord;
He said, “I’ll be a God to you,”
And I believed His word.
But now I have a deeper stroke
Than all my groanings are;
My God has me of late forsook;
He’s gone, I know not where.

Oh, what immortal joys I felt
On that celestial day,
When my hard heart began to melt,
By love dissolved away!
But my complaint is bitter now,
For all my joys are gone;
I’ve strayed! I’m left! I know not how;
The light’s from me withdrawn.

Once I could joy the saints to meet,
To me they were most dear;
I then could stoop to wash their feet,
And shed a joyful tear;
But now I meet them as the rest,
And with them joyless stay;
My conversation’s spiritless,
Or else I’ve naught to say.

I once could mourn o’er dying men,
And longed their souls to win;
I travailed for their poor children,
And warned them of their sin;
But now my heart’s so careless grown,
Although they’re drowned in vice;
My bowels o’er them cease to yearn—
My tears have left mine eyes.

I forward go in duty’s way,
But can’t perceive Him there;
Then backward on the road I stray,
But cannot find Him there;
On the left hand, where He doth work,
Among the wicked crew,
And on the right I find Him not
Among the favored few.

What shall I do? shall I lie down
And sink in deep despair?
Will He forever wear a frown,
Nor hear my feeble prayer?
No, He will put His strength in me,
He knows the way I’ve strolled,
And when I’m tried sufficiently
I shall come forth as gold.

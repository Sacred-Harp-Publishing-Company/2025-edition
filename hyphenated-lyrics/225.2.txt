# CHRISTMAS ANTHEM

Oh, how charm-ing
Are the ra-diant bands of mu-sic, mu-sic, mu-sic, mu-sic!
Oh, how charm-ing
Are the ra-diant bands of mu-sic,
Fly-ing in the air.

The church tri-um-phant gives the tone
While they sur-round the ho-ly throne,
In glo-ry, with ce-les-tial arts,
An-gel-ic ar-mies tune their harps,
And rap-tured ser-aphs play their parts:

Strike, strike, strike their notes at our Re-deem-er’s birth.

------

Oh, how charming
Are the radiant bands of music, music, music, music!
Oh, how charming
Are the radiant bands of music,
Flying in the air.

The church triumphant gives the tone
While they surround the holy throne,
In glory, with celestial arts,
Angelic armies tune their harps,
And raptured seraphs play their parts:

Strike, strike, strike their notes at our Redeemer’s birth.

# NINETY-THIRD PSALM

Grace! ’tis a charm-ing sound,
Har-mo-nious to the ear;
Heav’n with the ech-o shall re-sound,
And all the earth shall hear.

Grace first con-trived the way
To save re-bel-lious man
And all the steps that grace dis-play,
Which drew the won-drous plan.

Grace taught my wan-d’ring feet
To tread the heav’n-ly road,
And new sup-plies each hour I meet,
While press-ing on to God.

Grace all the work shall crown
Through ev-er-last-ing days;
It lays in heav’n the top-most stone,
And well de-serves our praise.

Grace! ’tis a charming sound,
Harmonious to the ear;
Heav’n with the echo shall resound,
And all the earth shall hear.

Grace first contrived the way
To save rebellious man
And all the steps that grace display,
Which drew the wondrous plan.

Grace taught my wand’ring feet
To tread the heav’nly road,
And new supplies each hour I meet,
While pressing on to God.

Grace all the work shall crown
Through everlasting days;
It lays in heav’n the topmost stone,
And well deserves our praise.

# THE DYING FRIEND

Young peo-ple, hear me as your friend,
Whose days on earth are at an end;
Your tal-ents to the Sav-ior lend
And live for-ev-er-more.

His Word will guide you here be-low;
Great love and mer-cy He will show;
And then with Je-sus you may go
And live for-ev-er-more.

With you no long-er I may dwell,
But His great love for you I tell;
I’m read-y now to bid fare-well
And live for-ev-er-more.

Young people, hear me as your friend,
Whose days on earth are at an end;
Your talents to the Savior lend
And live forevermore.

His Word will guide you here below;
Great love and mercy He will show;
And then with Jesus you may go
And live forevermore.

With you no longer I may dwell,
But His great love for you I tell;
I’m ready now to bid farewell
And live forevermore.

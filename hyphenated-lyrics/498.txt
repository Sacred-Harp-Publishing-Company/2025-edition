# THE RESURRECTION DAY

Oh, Res-ur-rec-tion Day!
When Christ the Sav-ior comes some morn-ing fair,
The grave will o-pen wide
And saints will rise to meet Him in the air.

[chorus]
Oh! may we meet in heav’n
To sing the prais-es of our Lord and King,
And gath-ered round the snow-white throne
Make heav-en’s por-tals ring.

Oh, Resurrection Day!
When Christ the Savior comes some morning fair,
The grave will open wide
And saints will rise to meet Him in the air.

[chorus]
Oh! may we meet in heav’n
To sing the praises of our Lord and King,
And gathered round the snow-white throne
Make heaven’s portals ring.

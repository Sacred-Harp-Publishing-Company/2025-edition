# GREENWICH

Lord, what a thought-less wretch was I
To mourn and mur-mur and re-pine
To see the wick-ed, placed on high,
In pride and robes of hon-or shine.
But oh their end, their dread-ful end!
Thy sanc-tu-ar-y taught me so;
On slip-p’ry rocks I see them stand,
And fier-y bil-lows roll be-low.

Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I
To mourn and murmur and repine
To see the wicked, placed on high,
In pride and robes of honor shine.
But oh their end, their dreadful end!
Thy sanctuary taught me so;
On slipp’ry rocks I see them stand,
And fiery billows roll below.

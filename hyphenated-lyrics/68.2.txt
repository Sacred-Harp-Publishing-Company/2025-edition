How sweet the name of Je-sus sounds
In a be-liev-er’s ear!
It soothes his sor-rows, heals his wounds,
And drives a-way his fear.

It makes the wound-ed spir-it whole,
And calms the trou-bled breast;
’Tis man-na to the hun-gry soul,
And to the wea-ry rest.

Dear name! the rock on which I build,
My shield and hid-ing place,
My nev-er-fail-ing trea-sury filled
With bound-less stores of grace.

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.

Dear name! the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place,
My never-failing treasury filled
With boundless stores of grace.

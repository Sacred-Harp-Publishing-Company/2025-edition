The time is swift-ly roll-ing on
When I must faint and die,
My bod-y to the dust re-turn,
And there for-got-ten lie.

Let per-se-cu-tion rage a-round,
And An-ti-christ ap-pear:
My si-lent dust be-neath the ground,
There’s no dis-tur-bance there.

My broth-er preach-ers, fare you well,
Your fel-low-ship I love;
In time no more I shall you see,
And soon we’ll meet a-bove.

The time is swiftly rolling on
When I must faint and die,
My body to the dust return,
And there forgotten lie.

Let persecution rage around,
And Antichrist appear:
My silent dust beneath the ground,
There’s no disturbance there.

My brother preachers, fare you well,
Your fellowship I love;
In time no more I shall you see,
And soon we’ll meet above.

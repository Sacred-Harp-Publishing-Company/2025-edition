# PRIMROSE HILL

When I can read my ti-tle clear
To man-sions in the skies,
I’ll bid fare-well to ev-’ry fear,
And wipe my weep-ing eyes.

Should earth a-gainst my soul en-gage,
And fier-y darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Sa-tan’s rage,
And face a frown-ing world.

Let cares like a wild del-uge come,
Let storms of sor-row fall,
So I but safe-ly reach my home,
My God, my heav’n, my all.

There I shall bathe my wea-ry soul
In seas of heav’n-ly rest,
And not a wave of trou-ble roll
A-cross my peace-ful breast.

When I can read my title clear
To mansions in the skies,
I’ll bid farewell to ev’ry fear,
And wipe my weeping eyes.

Should earth against my soul engage,
And fiery darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,
And face a frowning world.

Let cares like a wild deluge come,
Let storms of sorrow fall,
So I but safely reach my home,
My God, my heav’n, my all.

There I shall bathe my weary soul
In seas of heav’nly rest,
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast.

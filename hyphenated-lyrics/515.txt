My dear Re-deem-er and my Lord,
I read my du-ty in Thy Word;
But in Thy life the law ap-pears,
Drawn out in liv-ing char-ac-ters.

Cold moun-tains and the mid-night air
Wit-nessed the fer-vor of Thy prayer;
The des-ert Thy temp-ta-tions knew,
Thy con-flict and Thy vic-t’ry, too.

Be Thou my pat-tern; make me bear
More of Thy gra-cious im-age here;
Then God, the Judge, shall own my name
A-mong the fol-l’wers of the Lamb.

My dear Redeemer and my Lord,
I read my duty in Thy Word;
But in Thy life the law appears,
Drawn out in living characters.

Cold mountains and the midnight air
Witnessed the fervor of Thy prayer;
The desert Thy temptations knew,
Thy conflict and Thy vict’ry, too.

Be Thou my pattern; make me bear
More of Thy gracious image here;
Then God, the Judge, shall own my name
Among the foll’wers of the Lamb.

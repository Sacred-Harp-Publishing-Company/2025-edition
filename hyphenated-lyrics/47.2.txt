And am I born to die?
To lay this bod-y down?
And must my trem-bling spir-it fly
In-to a world un-known?

A land of deep-est shade,
Un-pierced by hu-man thought,
The drea-ry re-gions of the dead,
Where all things are for-got.

Soon as from earth I go,
What will be-come of me?
E-ter-nal hap-pi-ness or woe
Must then my por-tion be!

Waked by the trum-pet sound,
I from my grave shall rise,
And see the Judge with glo-ry crowned,
And see the flam-ing skies!

And am I born to die?
To lay this body down?
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown?

A land of deepest shade,
Unpierced by human thought,
The dreary regions of the dead,
Where all things are forgot.

Soon as from earth I go,
What will become of me?
Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be!

Waked by the trumpet sound,
I from my grave shall rise,
And see the Judge with glory crowned,
And see the flaming skies!

# JEFFERSON

Glo-rious things of thee are spo-ken,
Zi-on, cit-y of our God!
He whose word can ne’er be bro-ken
Formed thee for His own a-bode.

[chorus]
On the Rock of ag-es found-ed,
Who can shake thy sure re-pose?
With sal-va-tion’s wall sur-round-ed,
Thou mayst smile at all thy foes.

Round her hab-i-ta-tion hov-’ring,
See the cloud and fire ap-pear,
For a glo-ry and a cov-’ring,
Show-ing that the Lord is near.

------

Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God!
He whose word can ne’er be broken
Formed thee for His own abode.

[chorus]
On the Rock of ages founded,
Who can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation’s wall surrounded,
Thou mayst smile at all thy foes.

Round her habitation hov’ring,
See the cloud and fire appear,
For a glory and a cov’ring,
Showing that the Lord is near.

Ye fleet-ing charms of earth, fare-well,
Your springs of joy are dry.
My soul now seeks an-oth-er home,
A bright-er world on high.

[chorus]
I’m a long time trav-el-ing here be-low,
I’m a long time trav-el-ing a-way from home;
I’m a long time trav-el-ing here be-low
To lay this bod-y down.

Fare-well, my friends, whose ten-der care
Has long en-gaged my love;
Your fond em-brace I now ex-change
For bet-ter friends a-bove.

------

Ye fleeting charms of earth, farewell,
Your springs of joy are dry.
My soul now seeks another home,
A brighter world on high.

[chorus]
I’m a long time traveling here below,
I’m a long time traveling away from home;
I’m a long time traveling here below
To lay this body down.

Farewell, my friends, whose tender care
Has long engaged my love;
Your fond embrace I now exchange
For better friends above.

# HALLELUJAH

And let this fee-ble bod-y fail,
And let it faint or die;
My soul shall quit this mourn-ful vale,
And soar to worlds on high.

[chorus]
And I’ll sing hal-le-lu-jah,
And you’ll sing hal-le-lu-jah,
And we’ll all sing hal-le-lu-jah,
When we ar-rive at home.

Shall join the dis-em-bod-ied saints
And find its long-sought rest,
That on-ly bliss for which it pants,
In my Re-deem-er’s breast.

O what are all my suf-f’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that en-rap-tured host t’ap-pear,
And wor-ship at Thy feet!

Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends a-way,
But let me find them all a-gain
In that e-ter-nal day.

------

And let this feeble body fail,
And let it faint or die;
My soul shall quit this mournful vale,
And soar to worlds on high.

[chorus]
And I’ll sing hallelujah,
And you’ll sing hallelujah,
And we’ll all sing hallelujah,
When we arrive at home.

Shall join the disembodied saints
And find its long-sought rest,
That only bliss for which it pants,
In my Redeemer’s breast.

O what are all my suff’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that enraptured host t’appear,
And worship at Thy feet!

Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends away,
But let me find them all again
In that eternal day.

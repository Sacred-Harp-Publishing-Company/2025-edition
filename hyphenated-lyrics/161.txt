Come a-way to the skies,
My be-lov-ed, a-rise,
And re-joice in the day thou wast born:
On this fes-ti-val day,
Come ex-ult-ing a-way,
And with sing-ing to Zi-on re-turn.
Now with sing-ing and praise
Let us spend all the days
By our heav-en-ly Fa-ther be-stowed,
While His grace we re-ceive
From His boun-ty, and live
To the hon-or and glo-ry of God.

For the glo-ry we were
First cre-at-ed to share,
Both the na-ture and king-dom di-vine!
Now cre-at-ed a-gain
That our lives may re-main
Through-out time and e-ter-ni-ty Thine.
Hal-le-lu-jah we sing
To the heav-en’s high King,
And His rap-tur-ous prais-es re-peat;
To the Lamb that was slain,
Hal-le-lu-jah a-gain
Sing, all heav-en, and fall at His feet.

------

Come away to the skies,
My beloved, arise,
And rejoice in the day thou wast born:
On this festival day,
Come exulting away,
And with singing to Zion return.
Now with singing and praise
Let us spend all the days
By our heavenly Father bestowed,
While His grace we receive
From His bounty, and live
To the honor and glory of God.

For the glory we were
First created to share,
Both the nature and kingdom divine!
Now created again
That our lives may remain
Throughout time and eternity Thine.
Hallelujah we sing
To the heaven’s high King,
And His rapturous praises repeat;
To the Lamb that was slain,
Hallelujah again
Sing, all heaven, and fall at His feet.

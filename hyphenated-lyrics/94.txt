# NEVER PART

Come, hum-ble sin-ner, in whose breast
A thou-sand thoughts re-volve;
Come, with your guilt and fear op-pressed,
And make this last re-solve.

[chorus]
We’re march-ing through Im-man-uel’s ground,
And soon shall hear the trum-pet sound,
And then all shall with Je-sus reign,
And nev-er, nev-er part a-gain.
What? nev-er part a-gain?
No, nev-er part a-gain,
And soon shall hear the trum-pet sound,
And nev-er, nev-er part a-gain.

------

Come, humble sinner, in whose breast
A thousand thoughts revolve;
Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed,
And make this last resolve.

[chorus]
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
And soon shall hear the trumpet sound,
And then all shall with Jesus reign,
And never, never part again.
What? never part again?
No, never part again,
And soon shall hear the trumpet sound,
And never, never part again.

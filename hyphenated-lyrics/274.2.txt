# ROLL JORDAN

He comes! He comes! the Judge se-vere,
Roll, Jor-dan, roll;
The sev-enth trum-pet speaks Him near,
Roll, Jor-dan, roll.

[chorus]
I want to go to heav’n, I do,
Hal-le-lu-jah, Lord;
We’ll praise the Lord in heav’n a-bove,
Roll, Jor-dan, roll.

His light-nings flash, His thun-ders roll,
Roll, Jor-dan, roll;
How wel-come to the faith-ful soul!
Roll, Jor-dan, roll.

------

He comes! He comes! the Judge severe,
Roll, Jordan, roll;
The seventh trumpet speaks Him near,
Roll, Jordan, roll.

[chorus]
I want to go to heav’n, I do,
Hallelujah, Lord;
We’ll praise the Lord in heav’n above,
Roll, Jordan, roll.

His lightnings flash, His thunders roll,
Roll, Jordan, roll;
How welcome to the faithful soul!
Roll, Jordan, roll.

# HAPPY CHRISTIAN

Oh, how hap-py are they
Who their Sav-ior o-bey
And have laid up their treas-ures a-bove;
Tongue can nev-er ex-press
The sweet com-fort and peace
Of a soul in its ear-li-est love.

That sweet com-fort was mine
When the fa-vor di-vine
I first found in the blood of the Lamb;
When at first I be-lieved,
What true joy I re-ceived,
What a ha-ven in Je-sus’ sweet name.

’Twas a heav-en be-low
My Re-deem-er to know,
And the an-gels could do noth-ing more
Than to fall at His feet
And the sto-ry re-peat
And the lov-er of sin-ners a-dore.

Oh, how happy are they
Who their Savior obey
And have laid up their treasures above;
Tongue can never express
The sweet comfort and peace
Of a soul in its earliest love.

That sweet comfort was mine
When the favor divine
I first found in the blood of the Lamb;
When at first I believed,
What true joy I received,
What a haven in Jesus’ sweet name.

’Twas a heaven below
My Redeemer to know,
And the angels could do nothing more
Than to fall at His feet
And the story repeat
And the lover of sinners adore.

# EASTON

What dost thou see, O watch-man?
What dost thou see a-far?
The gleam-ing of a ban-ner,
The ris-ing of a star.

Then cry a-loud, O watch-man,
With trum-pet voice pro-claim
To all a full sal-va-tion
Through Christ the Sav-ior’s name.

------

What dost thou see, O watchman?
What dost thou see afar?
The gleaming of a banner,
The rising of a star.

Then cry aloud, O watchman,
With trumpet voice proclaim
To all a full salvation
Through Christ the Savior’s name.

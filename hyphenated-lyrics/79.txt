# THE OLD SHIP OF ZION

What ship is this that will take us all home,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
And safe-ly land us on Ca-naan’s bright shore?
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

[chorus]
’Tis the old ship of Zi-on, hal-le-lu, hal-le-lu,
’Tis the old ship of Zi-on, hal-le-lu-jah!

The winds may blow, and the bil-lows may foam,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
But she is a-ble to land us all home,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

She land-ed all who have gone be-fore,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
And yet she’s a-ble to land still more,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

If I ar-rive there be-fore you do,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
I’ll tell them that you are com-ing up too,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

What ship is this that will take us all home,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!
And safely land us on Canaan’s bright shore?
Oh, glory, hallelujah!

[chorus]
’Tis the old ship of Zion, hallelu, hallelu,
’Tis the old ship of Zion, hallelujah!

The winds may blow, and the billows may foam,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!
But she is able to land us all home,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!

She landed all who have gone before,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!
And yet she’s able to land still more,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!

If I arrive there before you do,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!
I’ll tell them that you are coming up too,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!

# LOVE THE LORD

A-las! and did my Sav-ior bleed?
And did my Sov-’reign die?
Would He de-vote that sa-cred head
For such a worm as I?

[chorus]
O who is like Je-sus? hal-le-lu-jah,
Praise ye the Lord;
There’s none like Je-sus, hal-le-lu-jah,
Love and serve the Lord.

Alas! and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sov’reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

[chorus]
O who is like Jesus? hallelujah,
Praise ye the Lord;
There’s none like Jesus, hallelujah,
Love and serve the Lord.

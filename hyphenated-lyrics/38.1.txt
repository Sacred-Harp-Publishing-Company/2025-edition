# WINTER

His hoar-y frost, His fleec-y snow,
De-scend and clothe the ground;
The liq-uid streams for-bear to flow,
In ic-y fet-ters bound.

He sends His word and melts the snow,
The fields no long-er mourn;
He calls the warm-er gales to blow
And bids the spring re-turn.

His hoary frost, His fleecy snow,
Descend and clothe the ground;
The liquid streams forbear to flow,
In icy fetters bound.

He sends His word and melts the snow,
The fields no longer mourn;
He calls the warmer gales to blow
And bids the spring return.

# SERVICE OF THE LORD

Fare-well, vain world, I’m go-ing home;
I am bound to die in the ar-my.
My Sav-ior smiles and bids me come;
I am bound to die in the ar-my.

[chorus]
I am bound to live in the ser-vice of my Lord,
I am bound to die in the ar-my.

Sweet an-gels beck-on me a-way;
I am bound to die in the ar-my.
To sing God’s praise in end-less day;
I am bound to die in the ar-my.

------

Farewell, vain world, I’m going home;
I am bound to die in the army.
My Savior smiles and bids me come;
I am bound to die in the army.

[chorus]
I am bound to live in the service of my Lord,
I am bound to die in the army.

Sweet angels beckon me away;
I am bound to die in the army.
To sing God’s praise in endless day;
I am bound to die in the army.

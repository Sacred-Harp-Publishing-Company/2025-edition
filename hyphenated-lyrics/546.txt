# MY BRIGHTEST DAYS

My God, the spring of all my joys,
The life of my de-lights,
The glo-ry of my bright-est days,
And com-fort of my nights!

In dark-est shades if He ap-pears,
My dawn-ing is be-gun:
He is my soul’s sweet morn-ing star,
And He’s my ris-ing sun.

------

My God, the spring of all my joys,
The life of my delights,
The glory of my brightest days,
And comfort of my nights!

In darkest shades if He appears,
My dawning is begun:
He is my soul’s sweet morning star,
And He’s my rising sun.

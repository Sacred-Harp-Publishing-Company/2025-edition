# SINNER’S FRIEND

He dies! the friend of sin-ners dies!
And He died on the cross for sin-ners,
Lo! Sa-lem’s daugh-ters weep a-round!
And He died on the cross for sin-ners.

[chorus]
I love my Lord, for He first loved me,
And He died on the cross for sin-ners.

------

He dies! the friend of sinners dies!
And He died on the cross for sinners,
Lo! Salem’s daughters weep around!
And He died on the cross for sinners.

[chorus]
I love my Lord, for He first loved me,
And He died on the cross for sinners.

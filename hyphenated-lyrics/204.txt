# MISSION

Young peo-ple, all at-ten-tion give,
While I ad-dress you in God’s name.
You who in sin and fol-ly live,
Come, hear the coun-sel of a friend.
I’ve sought for bliss in glit-t’ring toys
And ranged the lur-ing scenes of vice,
But nev-er knew sub-stan-tial joys
Un-til I heard my Sav-ior’s voice.

He spake at once my sins for-giv’n,
And washed my load of guilt a-way.
He gave me glo-ry, peace, and heav’n,
And thus I found the heav’n-ly way.
And now with trem-bling sense I view
The bil-lows roll be-neath your feet,
For death e-ter-nal waits for you,
Who slight the force of gos-pel truth.

Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By fleet-ing time or con-qu’ring death;
Your morn-ing sun may set at noon,
And leave you ev-er in the dark.
Your spar-kling eyes and bloom-ing cheeks
Must with-er like the blast-ed rose;
The cof-fin, earth, and wind-ing sheet
Will soon your ac-tive limbs en-close.

Young people, all attention give,
While I address you in God’s name.
You who in sin and folly live,
Come, hear the counsel of a friend.
I’ve sought for bliss in glitt’ring toys
And ranged the luring scenes of vice,
But never knew substantial joys
Until I heard my Savior’s voice.

He spake at once my sins forgiv’n,
And washed my load of guilt away.
He gave me glory, peace, and heav’n,
And thus I found the heav’nly way.
And now with trembling sense I view
The billows roll beneath your feet,
For death eternal waits for you,
Who slight the force of gospel truth.

Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By fleeting time or conqu’ring death;
Your morning sun may set at noon,
And leave you ever in the dark.
Your sparkling eyes and blooming cheeks
Must wither like the blasted rose;
The coffin, earth, and winding sheet
Will soon your active limbs enclose.

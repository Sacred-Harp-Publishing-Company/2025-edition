# SWEET RIVERS

Sweet riv-ers of re-deem-ing love
Lie just be-fore mine eye;
Had I the pin-ions of a dove,
I’d to those riv-ers fly.
I’d rise su-pe-rior to my pain,
With joy out-strip the wind;
I’d cross o’er Jor-dan’s storm-y waves
And leave the world be-hind.

A few more days, or years at most,
My trou-bles will be o’er;
I hope to join the heav’n-ly host
On Ca-naan’s hap-py shore.
My rap-tured soul shall drink and feast
In love’s un-bound-ed sea;
The glo-rious hope of end-less rest
Is rav-ish-ing for me.

Sweet rivers of redeeming love
Lie just before mine eye;
Had I the pinions of a dove,
I’d to those rivers fly.
I’d rise superior to my pain,
With joy outstrip the wind;
I’d cross o’er Jordan’s stormy waves
And leave the world behind.

A few more days, or years at most,
My troubles will be o’er;
I hope to join the heav’nly host
On Canaan’s happy shore.
My raptured soul shall drink and feast
In love’s unbounded sea;
The glorious hope of endless rest
Is ravishing for me.

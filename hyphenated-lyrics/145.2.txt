# SWEET AFFLICTION

In the floods of trib-u-la-tion,
While the bil-lows o’er me roll,
Je-sus whis-pers con-so-la-tion
And sup-ports my faint-ing soul.

[chorus]
Hal-le-lu-jah, Hal-le-lu-jah,
Hal-le-lu-jah, praise the Lord!

Wear-ing there a weight of glo-ry,
Still the path I’ll ne’er for-get,
But, ex-ult-ing, cry, it led me
To my bless-ed Sav-ior’s feet.

------

In the floods of tribulation,
While the billows o’er me roll,
Jesus whispers consolation
And supports my fainting soul.

[chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, praise the Lord!

Wearing there a weight of glory,
Still the path I’ll ne’er forget,
But, exulting, cry, it led me
To my blessed Savior’s feet.

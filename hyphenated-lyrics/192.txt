From all that dwell be-low the skies,
Let the Cre-a-tor’s praise a-rise:
Let the Re-deem-er’s name be sung
Through ev-’ry land, by ev-’ry tongue.
E-ter-nal are Thy mer-cies, Lord,
E-ter-nal truth at-tends Thy word;
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore
Till suns shall rise and set no more.

From all that dwell below the skies,
Let the Creator’s praise arise:
Let the Redeemer’s name be sung
Through ev’ry land, by ev’ry tongue.
Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord,
Eternal truth attends Thy word;
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore
Till suns shall rise and set no more.

# NEW HOPE

Je-sus, what shall I do to show
How much I love Thy charm-ing name?
Let my whole heart with rap-ture glow,
Thy bound-less good-ness to pro-claim.
Lord, if a dis-tant glimpse of Thee
Can give such sweet, such vast de-light,
What must the joy, the tri-umph be
To dwell for-ev-er in Thy sight?

Jesus, what shall I do to show
How much I love Thy charming name?
Let my whole heart with rapture glow,
Thy boundless goodness to proclaim.
Lord, if a distant glimpse of Thee
Can give such sweet, such vast delight,
What must the joy, the triumph be
To dwell forever in Thy sight?

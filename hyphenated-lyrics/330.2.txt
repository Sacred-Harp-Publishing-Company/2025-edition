# CHANDESSE

How long wilt Thou con-ceal Thy face?
My God, how long de-lay?
When shall I feel those heav’n-ly rays
That chase my fears a-way?
Be Thou my sun and Thou my shield,
My soul in safe-ty keep;
Make haste be-fore mine eyes are sealed
In death’s e-ter-nal sleep.

How long wilt Thou conceal Thy face?
My God, how long delay?
When shall I feel those heav’nly rays
That chase my fears away?
Be Thou my sun and Thou my shield,
My soul in safety keep;
Make haste before mine eyes are sealed
In death’s eternal sleep.

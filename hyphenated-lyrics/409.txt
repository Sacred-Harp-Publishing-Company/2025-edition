O let me hear Thy bliss-ful voice
In-spir-ing joys di-vine;
The bar-ren des-ert shall re-joice
If on-ly Thou art mine.
Thy pres-ence, Lord, can cheer my heart
And raise my spir-its high;
Thy smile can bid my pains de-part
Though earth-ly com-forts die.

O let me hear Thy blissful voice
Inspiring joys divine;
The barren desert shall rejoice
If only Thou art mine.
Thy presence, Lord, can cheer my heart
And raise my spirits high;
Thy smile can bid my pains depart
Though earthly comforts die.

# WEEPING SAVIOR

A-las! and did my Sav-ior bleed?
And did my Sov-’reign die?
Would He de-vote that sa-cred head
For such a worm as I?

[chorus]
Oh, come, sin-ner, you will hear
The Sav-ior say, “Weep not for me”;
See the Sav-ior on the cross!
Oh, sin-ner, hear Him cry,
“E-loi, E-loi,
La-ma sa-bach-tha-ni!”

Thus might I hide my blush-ing face,
While His dear cross ap-pears;
Dis-solve my heart in thank-ful-ness,
And melt mine eyes to tears.

But drops of grief can ne’er re-pay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give my-self a-way,
’Tis all that I can do.

Alas! and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sov’reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

[chorus]
Oh, come, sinner, you will hear
The Savior say, “Weep not for me”;
See the Savior on the cross!
Oh, sinner, hear Him cry,
“Eloi, Eloi,
Lama sabachthani!”

Thus might I hide my blushing face,
While His dear cross appears;
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt mine eyes to tears.

But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
’Tis all that I can do.

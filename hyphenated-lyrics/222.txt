Thy works of glo-ry, might-y Lord,
That rul’st the bois-t’rous sea,
The sons of cour-age shall re-cord,
Who tempt the dan-g’rous way.
At Thy com-mand the winds a-rise,
And swell the tow-’ring waves;
The men as-ton-ished mount the skies,
And sink in gap-ing graves.

Thy works of glory, mighty Lord,
That rul’st the boist’rous sea,
The sons of courage shall record,
Who tempt the dang’rous way.
At Thy command the winds arise,
And swell the tow’ring waves;
The men astonished mount the skies,
And sink in gaping graves.

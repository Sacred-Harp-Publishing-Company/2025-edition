# WEEPING SINNERS

Weep-ing sin-ners, dry your tears,
Je-sus on the throne ap-pears;
Mer-cy comes with balm-y wings,
Bids you His sal-va-tion sing.

Peace He brings you by His death,
Peace He speaks with ev-’ry breath;
Can you slight such heav’n-ly charms?
Flee, oh, flee to Je-sus’ arms.

Weeping sinners, dry your tears,
Jesus on the throne appears;
Mercy comes with balmy wings,
Bids you His salvation sing.

Peace He brings you by His death,
Peace He speaks with ev’ry breath;
Can you slight such heav’nly charms?
Flee, oh, flee to Jesus’ arms.

# LET US SING

Shall we ev-er meet a-gain at the house,
Then to make the cho-rus ring at the house of God?

[chorus]
Let us sing,
Sweet-ly sing,
At the house then we’ll sing,
Sweet-ly sing at the house of God.

------

Shall we ever meet again at the house,
Then to make the chorus ring at the house of God?

[chorus]
Let us sing,
Sweetly sing,
At the house then we’ll sing,
Sweetly sing at the house of God.

# HEAVENLY ANTHEM

The heav-ens de-clare the glo-ry of God;
The fir-ma-ment show-eth His hand-i-work.
Day un-to day ut-t’reth speech;
Night un-to night show-eth knowl-edge.
There is no speech nor lan-guage where their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
The law of the Lord is per-fect,
Con-vert-ing the soul:
The tes-ti-mo-ny of the Lord is sure, mak-ing wise the sim-ple.
The stat-utes of the Lord are right, re-joic-ing the heart:
The com-mand-ment of the Lord is pure, en-light-en-ing the eyes.
More-o-ver, by them is Thy ser-vant warned.
Let the words of my mouth and the med-i-ta-tions of my heart
Be ac-cept-a-ble in Thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Re-deem-er.

The heavens declare the glory of God;
The firmament showeth His handiwork.
Day unto day utt’reth speech;
Night unto night showeth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
Moreover, by them is Thy servant warned.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart
Be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.

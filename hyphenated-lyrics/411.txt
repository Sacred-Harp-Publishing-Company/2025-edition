# MORNING PRAYER

Come, let us raise our voic-es high,
And form a sa-cred song
To Him who rules the earth and sky,
And does our days pro-long.
Who through the night gave us to rest,
This morn-ing cheered our eyes;
And with the thou-sands of the blest,
In health made us to rise.

Ear-ly to God we’ll send our prayer,
Make haste to pray and praise,
That He may make our good His care,
And guide us all our days.
And when the night of death comes on,
And we shall end our days;
May His rich grace the theme pro-long
Of His e-ter-nal praise.

Come, let us raise our voices high,
And form a sacred song
To Him who rules the earth and sky,
And does our days prolong.
Who through the night gave us to rest,
This morning cheered our eyes;
And with the thousands of the blest,
In health made us to rise.

Early to God we’ll send our prayer,
Make haste to pray and praise,
That He may make our good His care,
And guide us all our days.
And when the night of death comes on,
And we shall end our days;
May His rich grace the theme prolong
Of His eternal praise.

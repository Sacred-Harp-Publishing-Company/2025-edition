# WEARY PILGRIM

Come, and taste, a-long with me,
The wea-ry pil-grim’s con-so-la-tion:
Bound-less mer-cy, run-ning free,
The ear-nest of com-plete sal-va-tion.
Joy and peace in Christ I find;
My heart to Him is all re-signed;
The full-ness of His pow’r I prove,
The sweet-ness of re-deem-ing love!
Je-sus is the pil-grim’s por-tion,
Love as bound-less as the o-cean.

When the world and flesh would rise,
And strive to draw me from my Sav-ior,
Strang-ers slight, or friends de-spise,
I then more high-ly prize His fa-vor.
Friends, be-lieve me when I tell,
If Christ be pres-ent all is well;
The world and flesh in vain may rise,
I all their ef-forts do de-spise.
In the world I’ve trib-u-la-tion,
But in Christ sweet con-so-la-tion.

Come, and taste, along with me,
The weary pilgrim’s consolation:
Boundless mercy, running free,
The earnest of complete salvation.
Joy and peace in Christ I find;
My heart to Him is all resigned;
The fullness of His pow’r I prove,
The sweetness of redeeming love!
Jesus is the pilgrim’s portion,
Love as boundless as the ocean.

When the world and flesh would rise,
And strive to draw me from my Savior,
Strangers slight, or friends despise,
I then more highly prize His favor.
Friends, believe me when I tell,
If Christ be present all is well;
The world and flesh in vain may rise,
I all their efforts do despise.
In the world I’ve tribulation,
But in Christ sweet consolation.

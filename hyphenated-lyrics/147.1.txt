# BOYLSTON

My God, my life, my love,
To Thee, to Thee I call;
I can-not live if Thou re-move,
For Thou art all in all.

Thy shin-ing grace can cheer
This dun-geon where I dwell;
’Tis par-a-dise when Thou art here,
If Thou de-part, ’tis hell.

The smil-ings of Thy face,
How a-mia-ble they are!
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine em-brace,
And no-where else but there.

To Thee, and Thee a-lone,
The an-gels owe their bliss;
They sit a-round Thy gra-cious throne,
And dwell where Je-sus is.

Not all the harps a-bove
Can make a heav’n-ly place,
If God His res-i-dence re-move,
Or but con-ceal His face.

My God, my life, my love,
To Thee, to Thee I call;
I cannot live if Thou remove,
For Thou art all in all.

Thy shining grace can cheer
This dungeon where I dwell;
’Tis paradise when Thou art here,
If Thou depart, ’tis hell.

The smilings of Thy face,
How amiable they are!
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine embrace,
And nowhere else but there.

To Thee, and Thee alone,
The angels owe their bliss;
They sit around Thy gracious throne,
And dwell where Jesus is.

Not all the harps above
Can make a heav’nly place,
If God His residence remove,
Or but conceal His face.

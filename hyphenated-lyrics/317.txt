# JACKSON

I am a strang-er here be-low,
And what I am is hard to know;
I am so vile, so prone to sin,
I fear that I’m not born a-gain.

When I ex-pe-rience call to mind,
My un-der-stand-ing is so blind,
All feel-ing sense seems to be gone,
Which makes me think that I am wrong.

I find my-self out of the way;
My thoughts are of-ten gone a-stray;
Like one a-lone I seem to be;
Oh, is there an-y-one like me?

I am a stranger here below,
And what I am is hard to know;
I am so vile, so prone to sin,
I fear that I’m not born again.

When I experience call to mind,
My understanding is so blind,
All feeling sense seems to be gone,
Which makes me think that I am wrong.

I find myself out of the way;
My thoughts are often gone astray;
Like one alone I seem to be;
Oh, is there anyone like me?

# FAMILY CIRCLE

Come, Thou Fount of ev-’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mer-cy, nev-er ceas-ing,
Call for songs of loud-est praise.

[chorus]
Bless the Lord, O my soul!
Praise the Lord, O my broth-er!
Shout and sing, O my sis-ter!
Give Him glo-ry, O my fa-ther!
And re-joice, O my moth-er!
And we’ll trav-el on to-geth-er,
And we’ll join heart and hands for Ca-naan.

Teach me some me-lo-dious son-net,
Sung by flam-ing tongues a-bove;
Praise the mount—O fix me on it—
Mount of God’s un-chang-ing love.

Oh, to grace how great a debt-or
Dai-ly I’m con-strained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fet-ter,
Bind my wan-d’ring heart to Thee.

Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

[chorus]
Bless the Lord, O my soul!
Praise the Lord, O my brother!
Shout and sing, O my sister!
Give Him glory, O my father!
And rejoice, O my mother!
And we’ll travel on together,
And we’ll join heart and hands for Canaan.

Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above;
Praise the mount—O fix me on it—
Mount of God’s unchanging love.

Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

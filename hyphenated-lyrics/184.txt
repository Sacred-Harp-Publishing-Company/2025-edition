# AND JESUS CRUCIFIED

Vain, de-lu-sive world, a-dieu,
With all of crea-ture good;
On-ly Je-sus I pur-sue,
Who bought us with His blood.
All thy pleas-ures I fore-go,
I tram-ple on thy wealth and pride;
On-ly Je-sus shall I know,
And Je-sus cru-ci-fied!

Oth-er knowl-edge I dis-dain,
’Tis all but van-i-ty;
Christ, the Lamb of God, was slain,
He tast-ed death for me.
Me to save from end-less woe
The sin a-ton-ing vic-tim died;
On-ly Je-sus shall I know,
And Je-sus cru-ci-fied!

Vain, delusive world, adieu,
With all of creature good;
Only Jesus I pursue,
Who bought us with His blood.
All thy pleasures I forego,
I trample on thy wealth and pride;
Only Jesus shall I know,
And Jesus crucified!

Other knowledge I disdain,
’Tis all but vanity;
Christ, the Lamb of God, was slain,
He tasted death for me.
Me to save from endless woe
The sin atoning victim died;
Only Jesus shall I know,
And Jesus crucified!

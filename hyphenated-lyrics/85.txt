# THE MORNING TRUMPET

O when shall I see Je-sus,
And reign with Him a-bove,
And shall hear the trum-pet sound in that morn-ing?
And from the flow-ing foun-tain
Drink ev-er-last-ing love,
And shall hear the trum-pet sound in that morn-ing?

[chorus]
Shout, O glo-ry! for I shall mount a-bove the skies,
When I hear the trum-pet sound in that morn-ing.

When shall I be de-liv-ered
From this vain world of sin,
And shall hear the trum-pet sound in that morn-ing?
And with my bless-ed Je-sus
Drink end-less pleas-ures in,
And shall hear the trum-pet sound in that morn-ing?

But now I am a sol-dier,
My Cap-tain’s gone be-fore;
He’s giv-en me my or-ders,
And bids me ne’er give o’er.

His prom-is-es are faith-ful—
A right-eous crown He’ll give,
And all His val-iant sol-diers
E-ter-nal-ly shall live.

Through grace I feel de-ter-mined
To con-quer, though I die,
And then a-way to Je-sus
On wings of love I’ll fly.

Fare-well to sin and sor-row,
I bid them both a-dieu!
And, O my friends, prove faith-ful,
And on your way pur-sue.

When-e’er you meet with trou-bles
And tri-als on your way,
Then cast your cares on Je-sus,
And don’t for-get to pray.

Gird on the gos-pel ar-mor
Of faith and hope and love,
And when the com-bat’s end-ed,
He’ll car-ry you a-bove.

O do not be dis-cour-aged,
For Je-sus is your Friend;
And if you lack for knowl-edge,
He’ll not re-fuse to lend.

Nei-ther will He up-braid you,
Though of-ten you re-quest;
He’ll give you grace to con-quer,
And take you home to rest.

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above,
And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning?
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love,
And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning?

[chorus]
Shout, O glory! for I shall mount above the skies,
When I hear the trumpet sound in that morning.

When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin,
And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning?
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in,
And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning?

But now I am a soldier,
My Captain’s gone before;
He’s given me my orders,
And bids me ne’er give o’er.

His promises are faithful—
A righteous crown He’ll give,
And all His valiant soldiers
Eternally shall live.

Through grace I feel determined
To conquer, though I die,
And then away to Jesus
On wings of love I’ll fly.

Farewell to sin and sorrow,
I bid them both adieu!
And, O my friends, prove faithful,
And on your way pursue.

Whene’er you meet with troubles
And trials on your way,
Then cast your cares on Jesus,
And don’t forget to pray.

Gird on the gospel armor
Of faith and hope and love,
And when the combat’s ended,
He’ll carry you above.

O do not be discouraged,
For Jesus is your Friend;
And if you lack for knowledge,
He’ll not refuse to lend.

Neither will He upbraid you,
Though often you request;
He’ll give you grace to conquer,
And take you home to rest.

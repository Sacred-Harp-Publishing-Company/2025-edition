# SEND A BLESSING

Oh, tell me no more of this world’s vain store;
The time for such tri-fles with me now is o’er.
A coun-try I found where true joys a-bound;
To dwell I’m de-ter-mined on that hap-py ground.

[chorus]
Send a bless-ing,
Send a bless-ing just now.

The souls that be-lieve in par-a-dise live,
And me in that num-ber will Je-sus re-ceive;
My soul, don’t de-lay—He calls thee a-way;
Rise, fol-low thy Sav-ior and bless the glad day.

But this I do find: we two are so joined,
He’ll not live in glo-ry and leave me be-hind;
So this is the race I’m run-ning through grace
Hence-forth—till ad-mit-ted to see my Lord’s face.

Oh, tell me no more of this world’s vain store;
The time for such trifles with me now is o’er.
A country I found where true joys abound;
To dwell I’m determined on that happy ground.

[chorus]
Send a blessing,
Send a blessing just now.

The souls that believe in paradise live,
And me in that number will Jesus receive;
My soul, don’t delay—He calls thee away;
Rise, follow thy Savior and bless the glad day.

But this I do find: we two are so joined,
He’ll not live in glory and leave me behind;
So this is the race I’m running through grace
Henceforth—till admitted to see my Lord’s face.

# NEW BRITAIN

A-maz-ing grace! how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now I’m found,
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears re-lieved;
How pre-cious did that grace ap-pear
The hour I first be-lieved!

Through man-y dan-gers, toils, and snares,
I have al-read-y come;
’Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has prom-ised good to me,
His word my hope se-cures;
He will my shield and por-tion be
As long as life en-dures.

The earth shall soon dis-solve like snow,
The sun for-bear to shine;
But God, who called me here be-low,
Will be for-ev-er mine.

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now I’m found,
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
’Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.

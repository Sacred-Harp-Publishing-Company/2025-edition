# WEEPING PILGRIM

You may tell them, fa-ther, when you see them—
I’m a poor, mourn-ing pil-grim, I’m bound for Ca-naan’s land.
You may tell them, moth-er, when you see them—
I’m a poor, mourn-ing pil-grim, I’m bound for Ca-naan’s land.

[chorus]
I weep, and I mourn, and I move slow-ly on—
I’m a poor, mourn-ing pil-grim, I’m bound for Ca-naan’s land.

You may tell them, broth-ers, when you see them—
I’m a poor, mourn-ing pil-grim, I’m bound for Ca-naan’s land.
You may tell them, sis-ters, when you see them—
I’m a poor, mourn-ing pil-grim, I’m bound for Ca-naan’s land.

I’m a poor, mourning pilgrim, I’m bound for Canaan’s land.

[chorus]
I weep, and I mourn, and I move slowly on—
I’m a poor, mourning pilgrim, I’m bound for Canaan’s land.

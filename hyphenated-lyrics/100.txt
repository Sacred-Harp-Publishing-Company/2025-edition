# THE BOWER OF PRAYER

To leave my dear friends, and with neigh-bors to part,
And go from my home, it af-fects not my heart
Like thoughts of ab-sent-ing my-self for a day
From that blest re-treat where I’ve cho-sen to pray.

Dear bow’r, where the pine and the pop-lar have spread,
And wove with the branch-es a roof o’er my head!
How oft have I knelt on the ev-er-green there,
And poured out my soul to my Sav-ior in prayer.

The ear-ly shrill notes of the loved night-in-gale
That dwelt in my bow’r I ob-served as my bell,
To call me to du-ty, while birds of the air
Sang an-thems of praise as I went to my prayer.

To leave my dear friends, and with neighbors to part,
And go from my home, it affects not my heart
Like thoughts of absenting myself for a day
From that blest retreat where I’ve chosen to pray.

Dear bow’r, where the pine and the poplar have spread,
And wove with the branches a roof o’er my head!
How oft have I knelt on the evergreen there,
And poured out my soul to my Savior in prayer.

The early shrill notes of the loved nightingale
That dwelt in my bow’r I observed as my bell,
To call me to duty, while birds of the air
Sang anthems of praise as I went to my prayer.

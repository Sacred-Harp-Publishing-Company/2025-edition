# HURRICANE CREEK

A-wake, my soul, in joy-ful lays,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah,
And sing thy great Re-deem-er’s praise,
Sing glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah.
He just-ly claims a song from thee,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, O how free!
Sing glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah, sing glo-ry, hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.

Though num-’rous hosts of might-y foes,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah,
Though earth and hell my way op-pose,
Sing glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah.
He safe-ly leads my soul a-long,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah,
His lov-ing-kind-ness, O how strong!
Sing glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah, sing glo-ry, hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.

------

Awake, my soul, in joyful lays,
Glory, hallelujah,
And sing thy great Redeemer’s praise,
Sing glory, hallelujah.
He justly claims a song from thee,
Glory, hallelujah,
His loving-kindness, O how free!
Sing glory, hallelujah, sing glory, halle, hallelujah.

Though num’rous hosts of mighty foes,
Glory, hallelujah,
Though earth and hell my way oppose,
Sing glory, hallelujah.
He safely leads my soul along,
Glory, hallelujah,
His loving-kindness, O how strong!
Sing glory, hallelujah, sing glory, halle, hallelujah.

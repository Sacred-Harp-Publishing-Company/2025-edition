The Lord in-to His gar-den comes,
The spic-es yield their rich per-fumes,
The lil-ies grow and thrive;
Re-fresh-ing show’rs of grace di-vine
From Je-sus flow to ev-’ry vine,
Which makes the dead re-vive.

O that this dry and bar-ren ground
In springs of wa-ter may a-bound,
A fruit-ful soil be-come;
The des-ert blos-soms as the rose,
While Je-sus con-quers all His foes
And makes His peo-ple one.

Come, breth-ren, ye that love the Lord,
Who taste the sweet-ness of His word,
In Je-sus’ ways go on;
Our trou-bles and our tri-als here
Will on-ly make us rich-er there,
When we ar-rive at home.

The glo-rious time is roll-ing on,
The gra-cious work is now be-gun;
My soul a wit-ness is:
I taste and see the par-don free
For all man-kind, as well as me:
Who come to Christ may live.

The Lord into His garden comes,
The spices yield their rich perfumes,
The lilies grow and thrive;
Refreshing show’rs of grace divine
From Jesus flow to ev’ry vine,
Which makes the dead revive.

O that this dry and barren ground
In springs of water may abound,
A fruitful soil become;
The desert blossoms as the rose,
While Jesus conquers all His foes
And makes His people one.

Come, brethren, ye that love the Lord,
Who taste the sweetness of His word,
In Jesus’ ways go on;
Our troubles and our trials here
Will only make us richer there,
When we arrive at home.

The glorious time is rolling on,
The gracious work is now begun;
My soul a witness is:
I taste and see the pardon free
For all mankind, as well as me:
Who come to Christ may live.

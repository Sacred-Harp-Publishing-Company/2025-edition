# TRAVELING PILGRIM

Fare-well, vain world, I’m go-ing home,
Where there’s no more storm-y clouds to rise.
My Sav-ior smiles and bids me come,
Where there’s no more storm-y clouds to rise.

[chorus]
To the land, to the land,
To the land I am bound,
Where there’s no more storm-y clouds to rise.

Sweet an-gels beck-on me a-way,
Where there’s no more storm-y clouds to rise.
To sing God’s praise in end-less day,
Where there’s no more storm-y clouds to rise.

------

Farewell, vain world, I’m going home,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.
My Savior smiles and bids me come,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.

[chorus]
To the land, to the land,
To the land I am bound,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.

Sweet angels beckon me away,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.
To sing God’s praise in endless day,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.

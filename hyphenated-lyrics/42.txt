Say, now, ye love-ly so-cial band,
Who walk the way to Ca-naan’s land,
Ye who have fled from So-dom’s plain,
Say, do you wish to turn a-gain?

O have you ven-tured to the field,
Well armed with hel-met, sword, and shield?
And shall the world, with dread a-larms,
Com-pel you now to ground your arms?

Say, now, ye lovely social band,
Who walk the way to Canaan’s land,
Ye who have fled from Sodom’s plain,
Say, do you wish to turn again?

O have you ventured to the field,
Well armed with helmet, sword, and shield?
And shall the world, with dread alarms,
Compel you now to ground your arms?

# THE LONE PILGRIM

I came to the place where the lone pil-grim lay,
And pen-sive-ly stood by his tomb,
When in a low whis-per I heard some-thing say,
“How sweet-ly he sleeps here a-lone.”

The tem-pest may howl, and the loud thun-ders roar,
And gath-er-ing storms may a-rise;
Yet calm are his feel-ings, at rest is his soul,
The tears are all wiped from his eyes.

The cause of his Mas-ter pro-pelled him from home,
He bade his com-pan-ions fare-well;
He blessed his dear chil-dren, who for him now mourn,
In far dis-tant re-gions they dwell.

He wan-dered an ex-ile and strang-er from home,
No kin-dred or rel-a-tive nigh;
He met the con-ta-gion and sank to his tomb,
His soul flew to man-sions on high.

O tell his com-pan-ions and chil-dren most dear
To weep not for him now he’s gone;
The same hand that led him through scenes most se-vere
Has kind-ly as-sist-ed him home.

I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay,
And pensively stood by his tomb,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
“How sweetly he sleeps here alone.”

The tempest may howl, and the loud thunders roar,
And gathering storms may arise;
Yet calm are his feelings, at rest is his soul,
The tears are all wiped from his eyes.

The cause of his Master propelled him from home,
He bade his companions farewell;
He blessed his dear children, who for him now mourn,
In far distant regions they dwell.

He wandered an exile and stranger from home,
No kindred or relative nigh;
He met the contagion and sank to his tomb,
His soul flew to mansions on high.

O tell his companions and children most dear
To weep not for him now he’s gone;
The same hand that led him through scenes most severe
Has kindly assisted him home.

# THE CHURCH’S DESOLATION

Well may Thy ser-vants mourn, my God,
The Church-’s des-o-la-tion;
The state of Zi-on calls a-loud
For grief and lam-en-ta-tion.
Once she was all a-live to Thee,
And thou-sands were con-vert-ed;
But now a sad re-verse we see:
Her glo-ry is de-part-ed.

And has re-li-gion left the Church
With-out a trace be-hind her?
Where shall I go, where shall I search,
That I once more may find her?
A-dieu, ye proud, ye light and gay,
I’ll seek the bro-ken-heart-ed,
Who weep when they of Zi-on say,
Her glo-ry is de-part-ed.

Some few, like good E-li-jah, stand,
While thou-sands have re-volt-ed;
In ear-nest for the heav’n-ly land
They nev-er yet have halt-ed.
With such, re-li-gion doth re-main,
For they are not per-vert-ed;
O may they all through them re-gain
The glo-ry that’s de-part-ed.

Well may Thy servants mourn, my God,
The Church’s desolation;
The state of Zion calls aloud
For grief and lamentation.
Once she was all alive to Thee,
And thousands were converted;
But now a sad reverse we see:
Her glory is departed.

And has religion left the Church
Without a trace behind her?
Where shall I go, where shall I search,
That I once more may find her?
Adieu, ye proud, ye light and gay,
I’ll seek the brokenhearted,
Who weep when they of Zion say,
Her glory is departed.

Some few, like good Elijah, stand,
While thousands have revolted;
In earnest for the heav’nly land
They never yet have halted.
With such, religion doth remain,
For they are not perverted;
O may they all through them regain
The glory that’s departed.

# JORDAN

There is a land of pure de-light
Where saints im-mor-tal reign;
In-fi-nite day ex-cludes the night,
And pleas-ures ban-ish pain.
Sweet fields be-yond the swell-ing flood
Stand dressed in liv-ing green;
So to the Jews old Ca-naan stood,
While Jor-dan rolled be-tween.

Oh, could we make our doubts re-move,
Those gloom-y doubts that rise,
And see the Ca-naan that we love
With un-be-cloud-ed eyes.
Could we but climb where Mo-ses stood
And view the land-scape o’er,
Not Jor-dan’s stream nor death’s cold flood
Should fright us from the shore.

There is a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.
Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
Stand dressed in living green;
So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between.

Oh, could we make our doubts remove,
Those gloomy doubts that rise,
And see the Canaan that we love
With unbeclouded eyes.
Could we but climb where Moses stood
And view the landscape o’er,
Not Jordan’s stream nor death’s cold flood
Should fright us from the shore.

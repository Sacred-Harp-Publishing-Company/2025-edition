# PRAISE GOD

Oh, for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free,
A heart that’s sprin-kled with His blood,
So free-ly shed for me.
Oh, for a heart sub-mis-sive, meek,
My great Re-deem-er’s throne,
Where on-ly Christ is heard to speak,
Where Je-sus reigns a-lone.

Oh, for a hum-ble, con-trite heart,
Be-liev-ing, true and clean,
Which nei-ther life nor death can part
From Him that dwells with-in.
A heart in ev-’ry thought re-newed,
And full of love di-vine,
Per-fect, and right, and pure, and good—
A cop-y, Lord, of Thine.

Oh, for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free,
A heart that’s sprinkled with His blood,
So freely shed for me.
Oh, for a heart submissive, meek,
My great Redeemer’s throne,
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone.

Oh, for a humble, contrite heart,
Believing, true and clean,
Which neither life nor death can part
From Him that dwells within.
A heart in ev’ry thought renewed,
And full of love divine,
Perfect, and right, and pure, and good—
A copy, Lord, of Thine.

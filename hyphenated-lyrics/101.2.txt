# HOLY CITY

There is a ho-ly cit-y,
A hap-py world a-bove,
Be-yond the star-ry re-gions,
Built by the God of love,
An ev-er-last-ing tem-ple,
And saints ar-rayed in white;
They serve their great Re-deem-er,
And dwell with Him in light.

It is no world of trou-ble,
The God of peace is there;
He wipes a-way their sor-rows,
He ban-ish-es their care;
Their joys are still in-creas-ing,
Their songs are ev-er new;
They praise th’e-ter-nal Fa-ther,
The Son and Spir-it, too.

And what shall be my jour-ney,
How long I’ll stay be-low,
Or what shall be my tri-als,
Are not for me to know;
In ev-’ry day of trou-ble
I’ll raise my thoughts on high;
I’ll think of the bright tem-ple,
And crowns a-bove the sky.

There is a holy city,
A happy world above,
Beyond the starry regions,
Built by the God of love,
An everlasting temple,
And saints arrayed in white;
They serve their great Redeemer,
And dwell with Him in light.

It is no world of trouble,
The God of peace is there;
He wipes away their sorrows,
He banishes their care;
Their joys are still increasing,
Their songs are ever new;
They praise th’eternal Father,
The Son and Spirit, too.

And what shall be my journey,
How long I’ll stay below,
Or what shall be my trials,
Are not for me to know;
In ev’ry day of trouble
I’ll raise my thoughts on high;
I’ll think of the bright temple,
And crowns above the sky.

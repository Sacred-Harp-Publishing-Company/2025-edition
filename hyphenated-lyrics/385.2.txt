# CAN I LEAVE YOU?

Yes, my na-tive land, I love thee,
All thy scenes I love them well,
Friends, con-nec-tions, hap-py coun-try,
Can I bid you all fare-well?

[chorus]
Can I leave you,
Far in dis-tant lands to dwell?

Home, thy joys are pass-ing love-ly,
Joys no strang-er heart can tell;
Hap-py home, in-deed I love thee;
Can I, can I, say “Fare-well”?

Scenes of sa-cred peace and pleas-ure,
Ho-ly days and Sab-bath bell,
Rich-est, bright-est, sweet-est treas-ure,
Can I say a last fare-well?

------

Yes, my native land, I love thee,
All thy scenes I love them well,
Friends, connections, happy country,
Can I bid you all farewell?

[chorus]
Can I leave you,
Far in distant lands to dwell?

Home, thy joys are passing lovely,
Joys no stranger heart can tell;
Happy home, indeed I love thee;
Can I, can I, say “Farewell”?

Scenes of sacred peace and pleasure,
Holy days and Sabbath bell,
Richest, brightest, sweetest treasure,
Can I say a last farewell?

# MOUNT DESERT

Un-shak-en as the sa-cred hill,
And firm as moun-tains be,
Firm as a rock the soul shall rest
That leans, O Lord, on Thee.

Not walls or hills could guard so well
Old Sa-lem’s hap-py ground,
As those e-ter-nal arms of love
That ev-’ry saint sur-round.

Unshaken as the sacred hill,
And firm as mountains be,
Firm as a rock the soul shall rest
That leans, O Lord, on Thee.

Not walls or hills could guard so well
Old Salem’s happy ground,
As those eternal arms of love
That ev’ry saint surround.

# HOMEWARD BOUND

The Lord is lead-ing me to-day;
His love shines all a-round:
De-light I find a-long the way,
For I am home-ward bound.
Soon the great call for me will come;
I’ll lay my ar-mor down,
From Him no more a-gain to roam,
For I am home-ward bound.

I nev-er knew the hap-pi-ness
That in His love is found;
Un-til He came, my soul to bless,
And now I’m home-ward bound.
He raised me from the depths of sin
To high-er, sol-id ground;
I’m drink-ing end-less pleas-ure in,
Since I am home-ward bound.

It will not give me cause to fear
To hear the trum-pet sound;
And as that hap-py time draws near,
I still am home-ward bound.
Soon I will strike the heav’n-ly lyre,
With saints of great re-nown,
And join that great har-mo-nious choir;
Oh, I am home-ward bound!

The Lord is leading me today;
His love shines all around:
Delight I find along the way,
For I am homeward bound.
Soon the great call for me will come;
I’ll lay my armor down,
From Him no more again to roam,
For I am homeward bound.

I never knew the happiness
That in His love is found;
Until He came, my soul to bless,
And now I’m homeward bound.
He raised me from the depths of sin
To higher, solid ground;
I’m drinking endless pleasure in,
Since I am homeward bound.

It will not give me cause to fear
To hear the trumpet sound;
And as that happy time draws near,
I still am homeward bound.
Soon I will strike the heav’nly lyre,
With saints of great renown,
And join that great harmonious choir;
Oh, I am homeward bound!

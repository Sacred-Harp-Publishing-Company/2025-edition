# SUPPLICATION

Cre-ate my na-ture pure with-in,
And form my soul a-verse to sin;
Let Thy good Spir-it ne’er de-part,
Nor hide Thy pres-ence from my heart.

I can-not live with-out Thy light,
Cast out and ban-ished from Thy sight;
Thy ho-ly joys, my God, re-store,
And guard me that I fall no more.

Create my nature pure within,
And form my soul averse to sin;
Let Thy good Spirit ne’er depart,
Nor hide Thy presence from my heart.

I cannot live without Thy light,
Cast out and banished from Thy sight;
Thy holy joys, my God, restore,
And guard me that I fall no more.

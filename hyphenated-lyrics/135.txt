Come, Thou Fount of ev-’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mer-cy, nev-er ceas-ing,
Call for songs of loud-est praise.
Teach me some me-lo-dious son-net,
Sung by flam-ing tongues a-bove;
Praise the mount—I’m fixed up-on it—
Mount of Thy re-deem-ing love!

Here I’ll raise my Eb-en-ez-er,
Hith-er, by Thy help, I’m come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleas-ure,
Safe-ly to ar-rive at home.
Je-sus sought me when a strang-er,
Wan-d’ring from the fold of God;
He, to res-cue me from dan-ger,
In-ter-posed His pre-cious blood.

Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above;
Praise the mount—I’m fixed upon it—
Mount of Thy redeeming love!

Here I’ll raise my Ebenezer,
Hither, by Thy help, I’m come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand’ring from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

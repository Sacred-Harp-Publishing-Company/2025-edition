# LOVER OF THE LORD

Lo-vers of pleas-ure more than God,
For you He suf-fered pain;
For you the Sav-ior spilt His blood,
And shall He bleed in vain?
Oh, you must be a lov-er of the Lord,
Or you can’t go to heav-en when you die.

Lovers of pleasure more than God,
For you He suffered pain;
For you the Savior spilt His blood,
And shall He bleed in vain?
Oh, you must be a lover of the Lord,
Or you can’t go to heaven when you die.

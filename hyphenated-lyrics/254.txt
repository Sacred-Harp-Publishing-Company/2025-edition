# WARSAW

Dear friends, fare-well! I do you tell,
Since you and I must part;
I go a-way, and here you stay,
But still we’re joined in heart.

Your love to me has been most free,
Your con-ver-sa-tion sweet;
How can I bear to jour-ney where
With you I can-not meet?

Your love to me has been most free,
Your conversation sweet;

With you I cannot meet?

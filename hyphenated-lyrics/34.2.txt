# ST. THOMAS

Come, sound His praise a-broad,
And hymns of glo-ry sing;
Je-ho-vah is the sov-’reign God,
The u-ni-ver-sal King.

He formed the deeps un-known;
He gave the seas their bound;
The wa-t’ry worlds are all His own,
And all the sol-id ground.

Come, wor-ship at His throne;
Come, bow be-fore the Lord;
We are His works, and not our own:
He formed us by His word.

Come, sound His praise abroad,
And hymns of glory sing;
Jehovah is the sov’reign God,
The universal King.

He formed the deeps unknown;
He gave the seas their bound;
The wat’ry worlds are all His own,
And all the solid ground.

Come, worship at His throne;
Come, bow before the Lord;
We are His works, and not our own:
He formed us by His word.

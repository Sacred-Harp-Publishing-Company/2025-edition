Why do we mourn de-part-ing friends,
Or shake at death’s a-larms?
’Tis but the voice that Je-sus sends
To call them to His arms.

Why should we trem-ble to con-vey
Their bod-ies to the tomb?
There the dear flesh of Je-sus lay,
And van-ished all the gloom.

Thence He a-rose, as-cend-ed high,
And showed our feet the way;
Up to the Lord our souls shall fly
At the great ris-ing day.

Why do we mourn departing friends,
Or shake at death’s alarms?
’Tis but the voice that Jesus sends
To call them to His arms.

Why should we tremble to convey
Their bodies to the tomb?
There the dear flesh of Jesus lay,
And vanished all the gloom.

Thence He arose, ascended high,
And showed our feet the way;
Up to the Lord our souls shall fly
At the great rising day.

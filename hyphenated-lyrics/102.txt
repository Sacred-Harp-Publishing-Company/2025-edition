# FULFILLMENT

See how the Scrip-tures are ful-fill-ing,
Poor sin-ners are re-turn-ing home;
The time that pro-phets were fore-tell-ing,
With signs and won-ders now is come.
The gos-pel trum-pets now are blow-ing
From sea to sea, from land to land;
God’s Ho-ly Spir-it down is pour-ing,
And Chris-tians join-ing heart and hand.

Ten thou-sand fall be-fore Je-ho-vah,
For mer-cy, mer-cy! loud they cry;
They rise, all shout-ing “Hal-le-lu-jah!”
And “Glo-ry be to God on high.”
But man-y cry, “It’s all dis-or-der,”
And dis-be-lieve God’s ho-ly word;
Yet Chris-tians sing and shout the loud-er,
“All glo-ry, glo-ry to the Lord.”

See how the Scriptures are fulfilling,
Poor sinners are returning home;
The time that prophets were foretelling,
With signs and wonders now is come.
The gospel trumpets now are blowing
From sea to sea, from land to land;
God’s Holy Spirit down is pouring,
And Christians joining heart and hand.

Ten thousand fall before Jehovah,
For mercy, mercy! loud they cry;
They rise, all shouting “Hallelujah!”
And “Glory be to God on high.”
But many cry, “It’s all disorder,”
And disbelieve God’s holy word;
Yet Christians sing and shout the louder,
“All glory, glory to the Lord.”

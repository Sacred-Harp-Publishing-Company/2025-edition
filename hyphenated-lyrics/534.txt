# NEW GEORGIA

The might-y hand of God doth reign,
As in the ag-es past;
His blood has en-tered death’s do-main
To guide us home at last.
His praise we’ll sing the earth a-round,
His praise we’ll sing,
And up-ward lift our eyes,
While slum-b’ring ten-ants of the ground
In liv-ing ar-mies rise.

When sun and moon, and earth, and stars,
And time shall be no more,
Through His own blood and bat-tle scars
We’ll land on Ca-naan’s shore.
His praise for-ev-er we shall sing,
His praise we’ll sing,
And mount the up-per sky,
And to the pal-ace of our King
On wings of love we’ll fly.

The mighty hand of God doth reign,
As in the ages past;
His blood has entered death’s domain
To guide us home at last.
His praise we’ll sing the earth around,
His praise we’ll sing,
And upward lift our eyes,
While slumb’ring tenants of the ground
In living armies rise.

When sun and moon, and earth, and stars,
And time shall be no more,
Through His own blood and battle scars
We’ll land on Canaan’s shore.
His praise forever we shall sing,
His praise we’ll sing,
And mount the upper sky,
And to the palace of our King
On wings of love we’ll fly.

# SARDIS

Come on, my fel-low pil-grims, come,
And let us all be hast-’ning home;
We soon shall land on yon blest shore,
Where pains and sor-rows are no more;
There we our Je-sus shall a-dore,
For-ev-er blest.

No pe-riod then our joys shall know,
Se-cure from ev-’ry mor-tal foe;
No sick-ness there, no want or pain
Shall e’er dis-turb our rest a-gain,
When with Im-man-u-el we reign,
For-ev-er blest.

Come on, my fellow pilgrims, come,
And let us all be hast’ning home;
We soon shall land on yon blest shore,
Where pains and sorrows are no more;
There we our Jesus shall adore,
Forever blest.

No period then our joys shall know,
Secure from ev’ry mortal foe;
No sickness there, no want or pain
Shall e’er disturb our rest again,
When with Immanuel we reign,
Forever blest.

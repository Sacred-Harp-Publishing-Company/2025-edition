# PARTING FRIENDS

Fare-well, my friends, I’m bound for Ca-naan,
I’m trav-’ling through the wil-der-ness;
Your com-pa-ny has been de-light-ful,
You, who doth leave my mind dis-tressed.
I go a-way, be-hind to leave you,
Per-haps nev-er to meet a-gain;
But if we nev-er have the pleas-ure,
I hope we’ll meet on Ca-naan’s land.

Farewell, my friends, I’m bound for Canaan,
I’m trav’ling through the wilderness;
Your company has been delightful,
You, who doth leave my mind distressed.
I go away, behind to leave you,
Perhaps never to meet again;
But if we never have the pleasure,
I hope we’ll meet on Canaan’s land.

# THE OLD GRAVEYARD

For-mer friends, oh, how I’ve sought them,
Just to cheer my droop-ing mind;
But they’ve gone, like leaves of au-tumn,
Driv’n be-fore a drea-ry wind.

[chorus]
Boast ye not of to-mor-row,
For you know not what the day may bring.

Death has laid them down to slum-ber;
Sol-emn thought to think that I
Soon will be one of that num-ber,
Soon, ah soon, with them to lie.

Former friends, oh, how I’ve sought them,
Just to cheer my drooping mind;
But they’ve gone, like leaves of autumn,
Driv’n before a dreary wind.

[chorus]
Boast ye not of tomorrow,
For you know not what the day may bring.

Death has laid them down to slumber;
Solemn thought to think that I
Soon will be one of that number,
Soon, ah soon, with them to lie.

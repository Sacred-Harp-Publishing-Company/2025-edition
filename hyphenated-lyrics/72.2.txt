# BELLEVUE

How firm a foun-da-tion, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His ex-cel-lent word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
You who un-to Je-sus for ref-uge have fled?

“Fear not, I am with thee; O be not dis-mayed!
I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
I’ll strength-en thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Up-held by my right-eous, om-nip-o-tent hand.

“When through the deep wa-ters I call thee to go,
The riv-ers of sor-row shall not o-ver-flow;
For I will be with thee, thy trou-bles to bless,
And sanc-ti-fy to thee thy deep-est dis-tress.

“The soul that on Je-sus hath leaned for re-pose,
I will not, I will not des-ert to his foes.
The soul, though all hell should en-deav-or to shake,
I’ll nev-er, no nev-er, no nev-er for-sake.”

How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?

“Fear not, I am with thee; O be not dismayed!
I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.

“When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

“The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes.
The soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake.”

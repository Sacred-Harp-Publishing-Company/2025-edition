# OLD HUNDRED

O come, loud an-thems let us sing,
Loud thanks to our Al-might-y King,
For we our voic-es high should raise
When our sal-va-tion’s Rock we praise.

O come, loud anthems let us sing,
Loud thanks to our Almighty King,
For we our voices high should raise
When our salvation’s Rock we praise.

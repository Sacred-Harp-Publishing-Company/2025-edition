# MANCHESTER

There is a land of pure de-light
Where saints im-mor-tal reign;
In-fi-nite day ex-cludes the night,
And pleas-ures ban-ish pain.
There ev-er-last-ing spring a-bides, there spring a-bides,
And nev-er-with-’ring flow’rs;
Death like a nar-row sea di-vides
This heav’n-ly land from ours.

There I shall bathe my wea-ry soul
In seas of heav’n-ly rest,
And not a wave of trou-ble roll
A-cross my peace-ful breast.
When we’ve been there ten thou-sand years, ten thou-sand years
Bright shin-ing as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first be-gun.

There is a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.
There everlasting spring abides, there spring abides,
And never-with’ring flow’rs;
Death like a narrow sea divides
This heav’nly land from ours.

There I shall bathe my weary soul
In seas of heav’nly rest,
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast.
When we’ve been there ten thousand years, ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.

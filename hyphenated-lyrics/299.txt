# NEW JERUSALEM

Lo, what a glo-rious sight ap-pears
To our be-liev-ing eyes:
The earth and seas are passed a-way,
And the old roll-ing skies!

From the third heav’n where God re-sides,
That ho-ly, hap-py place,
The New Je-ru-sa-lem comes down,
A-dorned with shin-ing grace.

Lo, what a glorious sight appears
To our believing eyes:
The earth and seas are passed away,
And the old rolling skies!

From the third heav’n where God resides,
That holy, happy place,
The New Jerusalem comes down,
Adorned with shining grace.

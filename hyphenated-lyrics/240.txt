# CHRISTIAN SONG

Mine eyes are now clos-ing to rest;
My bod-y must soon be re-moved,
And mold-’ring, lie bur-ied in dust,
No more to be en-vied or loved.

Ah! what is this draw-ing my breath,
And steal-ing my sens-es a-way?
O tell me, my soul, is it death,
Re-leas-ing me kind-ly from clay?

Now mount-ing, my soul shall de-scry
The re-gions of pleas-ure and love;
My spir-it tri-um-phant shall fly,
And dwell with my Sav-ior a-bove.

------

Mine eyes are now closing to rest;
My body must soon be removed,
And mold’ring, lie buried in dust,
No more to be envied or loved.

Ah! what is this drawing my breath,
And stealing my senses away?
O tell me, my soul, is it death,
Releasing me kindly from clay?

Now mounting, my soul shall descry
The regions of pleasure and love;
My spirit triumphant shall fly,
And dwell with my Savior above.

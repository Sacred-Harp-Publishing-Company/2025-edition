# THE CHRISTIAN WARFARE

I find my-self placed in a state of pro-ba-tion,
Which God has com-mand-ed us well to im-prove.
And I am re-solved to re-gard all His pre-cepts,
And on in the way of o-be-dience to move.
I know I must go through great trib-u-la-tion,
And man-y sore con-flicts on ev-e-ry hand;
But grace will sup-port and com-fort my spir-it,
And I shall be a-ble for-ev-er to stand.

I’m called to con-tend with the pow-ers of dark-ness,
And man-y sore con-flicts I have to pass through.
O Je-sus, be with me in ev-e-ry bat-tle,
And help me my en-e-mies all to sub-due.
If Thou, gra-cious Lord, will on-ly be with me,
To aid and di-rect me, then all will be right;
A-poll-yon, with all his pow-er-ful forc-es,
In Thy name and Thy strength shall soon put to flight.

I find myself placed in a state of probation,
Which God has commanded us well to improve.
And I am resolved to regard all His precepts,
And on in the way of obedience to move.
I know I must go through great tribulation,
And many sore conflicts on every hand;
But grace will support and comfort my spirit,
And I shall be able forever to stand.

I’m called to contend with the powers of darkness,
And many sore conflicts I have to pass through.
O Jesus, be with me in every battle,
And help me my enemies all to subdue.
If Thou, gracious Lord, will only be with me,
To aid and direct me, then all will be right;
Apollyon, with all his powerful forces,
In Thy name and Thy strength shall soon put to flight.

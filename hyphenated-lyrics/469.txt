# THY STRENGTH

Af-flict-ed saint, to Christ draw near,
Thy Sav-ior’s gra-cious prom-ise hear;
His faith-ful word de-clares to thee
That as thy days, thy strength shall be.

Should per-se-cu-tion rage and flame,
Still trust in thy Re-deem-er’s name;
In fier-y trials thou soon shalt see
That as thy days, thy strength shall be.

When called to bear thy weight-y cross,
Or sore af-flic-tion, pain, or loss,
Or deep dis-tress, or pov-er-ty,
Still, as thy days, thy strength shall be.

Afflicted saint, to Christ draw near,
Thy Savior’s gracious promise hear;
His faithful word declares to thee
That as thy days, thy strength shall be.

Should persecution rage and flame,
Still trust in thy Redeemer’s name;
In fiery trials thou soon shalt see
That as thy days, thy strength shall be.

When called to bear thy weighty cross,
Or sore affliction, pain, or loss,
Or deep distress, or poverty,
Still, as thy days, thy strength shall be.

# ETERNAL AGES

De-scend from heav’n, im-mor-tal Dove;
Stoop down and take us on Thy wings,
And mount, and bear us far a-bove
The reach of these in-fe-rior things:

[chorus]
Be-yond, be-yond this low-er sky,
Up where e-ter-nal ag-es roll,
Where sol-id pleas-ures nev-er die,
And fruits im-mor-tal feast the soul.

When shall the day, dear Lord, ap-pear,
That I shall mount to dwell a-bove,
And stand and bow a-mong them there,
And view Thy face, and sing, and love?

------

Descend from heav’n, immortal Dove;
Stoop down and take us on Thy wings,
And mount, and bear us far above
The reach of these inferior things:

[chorus]
Beyond, beyond this lower sky,
Up where eternal ages roll,
Where solid pleasures never die,
And fruits immortal feast the soul.

When shall the day, dear Lord, appear,
That I shall mount to dwell above,
And stand and bow among them there,
And view Thy face, and sing, and love?

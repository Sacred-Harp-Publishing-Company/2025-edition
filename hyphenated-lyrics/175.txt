# HIGHLANDS OF HEAVEN

Sin-ner, go, will you go,
To the high-lands of heav-en,
Where the storms nev-er blow,
And the long sum-mer’s giv-en?
Where the bright, bloom-ing flow’rs
Are their o-dors e-mit-ting,
And the leaves of the bow’rs
On the breez-es are flit-ting.

Where the saints, robed in white,
Cleansed in life’s flow-ing foun-tain,
Shin-ing, beau-teous and bright,
Shall in-hab-it the moun-tain.
Where no sin, nor dis-may,
Nei-ther trou-ble nor sor-row,
Will be felt for to-day,
Nor be feared for the mor-row.

Sinner, go, will you go,
To the highlands of heaven,
Where the storms never blow,
And the long summer’s given?
Where the bright, blooming flow’rs
Are their odors emitting,
And the leaves of the bow’rs
On the breezes are flitting.

Where the saints, robed in white,
Cleansed in life’s flowing fountain,
Shining, beauteous and bright,
Shall inhabit the mountain.
Where no sin, nor dismay,
Neither trouble nor sorrow,
Will be felt for today,
Nor be feared for the morrow.

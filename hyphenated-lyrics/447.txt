# WONDROUS CROSS

When I sur-vey the won-drous cross
On which the Prince of glo-ry died,
My rich-est gain I count but loss,
And pour con-tempt on all my pride.
For-bid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sac-ri-fice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sor-row and love flow min-gled down!
Did e’er such love and sor-row meet,
Or thorns com-pose so rich a crown?
Were the whole realm of na-ture mine,
That were a pres-ent far too small;
Love so a-maz-ing, so di-vine,
De-mands my soul, my life, my all.

Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

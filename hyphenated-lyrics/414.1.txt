# FAREWELL BRETHREN

Breth-ren, I bid you all fare-well,
And from my ver-y heart
Af-fec-tion-ate-ly I do tell
That you and I must part.

And if we part to meet no more
While we on earth re-main,
O may we meet on Ca-naan’s shore,
And nev-er part a-gain.

There shall we join to sing God’s praise,
And all His won-ders tell,
And tri-umph in His ho-ly ways;
So, breth-ren, fare you well.

------

Brethren, I bid you all farewell,
And from my very heart
Affectionately I do tell
That you and I must part.

And if we part to meet no more
While we on earth remain,
O may we meet on Canaan’s shore,
And never part again.

There shall we join to sing God’s praise,
And all His wonders tell,
And triumph in His holy ways;
So, brethren, fare you well.

# AT REST

The world can nev-er give
The bliss for which we sigh;
’Tis not the whole of life to live,
Nor all of death to die.

Be-yond this vale of tears
There is a life a-bove,
Un-meas-ured by the flight of years,
An end-less life of love.

Fare-well, dear friends, fare-well
For just a lit-tle while;
We’ll meet and sing on heav-en’s shore,
Where part-ing comes no more.

The world can never give
The bliss for which we sigh;
’Tis not the whole of life to live,
Nor all of death to die.

Beyond this vale of tears
There is a life above,
Unmeasured by the flight of years,
An endless life of love.

Farewell, dear friends, farewell
For just a little while;
We’ll meet and sing on heaven’s shore,
Where parting comes no more.

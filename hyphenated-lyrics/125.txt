# EXPRESSION

O Je-sus, my Sav-ior, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the pleas-ures of earth I re-sign.
Of ob-jects most pleas-ing, I love Thee the best;
With-out Thee I’m wretch-ed, but with Thee I’m blest.

Thou art my rich treas-ure, my joy and my love,
None rich-er pos-sessed by the an-gels a-bove;
For Thee all the pleas-ures of sense I for-go,
And wan-der a pil-grim, de-spis-ed be-low.

Thy Spir-it first taught me to know I was blind,
And taught me the way of sal-va-tion to find.
For when I was sink-ing in dread-ful de-spair,
My Je-sus re-lieved me and bid me not fear.

O Jesus, my Savior, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the pleasures of earth I resign.
Of objects most pleasing, I love Thee the best;
Without Thee I’m wretched, but with Thee I’m blest.

Thou art my rich treasure, my joy and my love,
None richer possessed by the angels above;
For Thee all the pleasures of sense I forgo,
And wander a pilgrim, despised below.

Thy Spirit first taught me to know I was blind,
And taught me the way of salvation to find.
For when I was sinking in dreadful despair,
My Jesus relieved me and bid me not fear.

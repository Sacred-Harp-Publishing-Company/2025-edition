# PRAY, BRETHREN, PRAY

Pray, breth-ren, pray, the prayer of faith a-vail-eth;
Pray, breth-ren, pray, on God your spir-it stay.

[chorus]
A few more days of sor-row, and the Lord will call us home,
To walk the gold-en streets of the new Je-ru-sa-lem.

Sing, breth-ren, sing, re-joice with joy and glad-ness;
Sing, breth-ren, sing, your songs of tri-umph bring.

Rise, breth-ren, rise, your souls by faith as-cend-ing;
Rise, breth-ren, rise, your home is in the skies.

Pray, brethren, pray, the prayer of faith availeth;
Pray, brethren, pray, on God your spirit stay.

[chorus]
A few more days of sorrow, and the Lord will call us home,
To walk the golden streets of the new Jerusalem.

Sing, brethren, sing, rejoice with joy and gladness;
Sing, brethren, sing, your songs of triumph bring.

Rise, brethren, rise, your souls by faith ascending;
Rise, brethren, rise, your home is in the skies.

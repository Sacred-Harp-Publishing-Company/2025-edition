# LOUISIANA

Come, lit-tle chil-dren, now we may
Par-take a lit-tle mor-sel,
For lit-tle songs and lit-tle ways
A-dorned a great a-pos-tle.
A lit-tle drop of Je-sus’ blood
Can make a feast of un-ion;
It is by lit-tle steps we move
In-to a full com-mun-ion.

A lit-tle faith doth might-y deeds,
Quite past all my re-count-ing;
Faith, like a lit-tle mus-tard seed,
Can move a loft-y moun-tain.
A lit-tle char-i-ty and zeal,
A lit-tle trib-u-la-tion,
A lit-tle pa-tience makes us feel
Great peace and con-so-la-tion.

A lit-tle cross with cheer-ful-ness,
A lit-tle self-de-ni-al,
Will serve to make our trou-bles less,
And bear the great-est tri-al.
The Spir-it like a lit-tle dove
On Je-sus once de-scend-ed;
To show His meek-ness and His love,
The em-blem was in-tend-ed.

The ti-tle of the lit-tle Lamb
Un-to our Lord was giv-en;
Such was our Sav-ior’s lit-tle name,
The Lord of earth and heav-en.
A lit-tle voice that’s small and still
Can rule the whole cre-a-tion;
A lit-tle stone the earth shall fill,
And hum-ble ev-’ry na-tion.

Come, little children, now we may
Partake a little morsel,
For little songs and little ways
Adorned a great apostle.
A little drop of Jesus’ blood
Can make a feast of union;
It is by little steps we move
Into a full communion.

A little faith doth mighty deeds,
Quite past all my recounting;
Faith, like a little mustard seed,
Can move a lofty mountain.
A little charity and zeal,
A little tribulation,
A little patience makes us feel
Great peace and consolation.

A little cross with cheerfulness,
A little self-denial,
Will serve to make our troubles less,
And bear the greatest trial.
The Spirit like a little dove
On Jesus once descended;
To show His meekness and His love,
The emblem was intended.

The title of the little Lamb
Unto our Lord was given;
Such was our Savior’s little name,
The Lord of earth and heaven.
A little voice that’s small and still
Can rule the whole creation;
A little stone the earth shall fill,
And humble ev’ry nation.

# NIGHT SONG

Great trou-bles with tu-mul-tuous noise
Like swell-ing seas a-round me spread;
Thy ris-ing waves drown all my joys,
And roll tre-men-dous o’er my head.
Yet will the Lord pro-vide His love
When I ad-dress His throne by day,
Nor in the night His grace re-move;
The night shall hear me sing and pray.

------

Great troubles with tumultuous noise
Like swelling seas around me spread;
Thy rising waves drown all my joys,
And roll tremendous o’er my head.
Yet will the Lord provide His love
When I address His throne by day,
Nor in the night His grace remove;
The night shall hear me sing and pray.

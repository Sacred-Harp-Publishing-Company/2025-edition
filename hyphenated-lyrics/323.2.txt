When bloom-ing youth is snatched a-way
By death’s re-sist-less hand,
Our hearts the mourn-ful trib-ute pay
Which pit-y must de-mand.

Let this vain world en-gage no more:
Be-hold the gap-ing tomb!
It bids us seize the pres-ent hour—
To-mor-row death may come.

Hope looks be-yond the bounds of time,
When what we now de-plore
Shall rise in full im-mor-tal prime,
And bloom to fade no more.

When blooming youth is snatched away
By death’s resistless hand,
Our hearts the mournful tribute pay
Which pity must demand.

Let this vain world engage no more:
Behold the gaping tomb!
It bids us seize the present hour—
Tomorrow death may come.

Hope looks beyond the bounds of time,
When what we now deplore
Shall rise in full immortal prime,
And bloom to fade no more.

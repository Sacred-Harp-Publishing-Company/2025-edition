How beau-teous are their feet
Who stand on Zi-on’s hill,
Who bring sal-va-tion on their tongues,
And words of peace re-veal!

How charm-ing is their voice!
How sweet the tid-ings are!
Zi-on, be-hold thy Sav-ior King,
He reigns and tri-umphs here!

And words of peace reveal!

How charming is their voice!
How sweet the tidings are!
Zion, behold thy Savior King,
He reigns and triumphs here!

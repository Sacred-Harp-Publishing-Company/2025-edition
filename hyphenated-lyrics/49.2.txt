Will God for-ev-er cast us off?
His wrath for-ev-er smoke
A-gainst the peo-ple of His love,
His lit-tle cho-sen flock?

Think of the tribes so dear-ly bought
With the Re-deem-er’s blood,
Nor let Thy Zi-on be for-got,
Where once Thy glo-ry stood.

Where once Thy church-es prayed and sang
Thy foes pro-fane-ly rage;
A-mid Thy gates their en-signs hang,
And there their hosts en-gage.

And still to height-en our dis-tress,
Thy pres-ence is with-drawn;
Thy wont-ed signs of pow’r and grace,
Thy pow’r and grace are gone.

No proph-et speaks to calm our grief,
But all in si-lence mourn,
Nor know the hour of our re-lief,
The hour of Thy re-turn.

------

Will God forever cast us off?
His wrath forever smoke
Against the people of His love,
His little chosen flock?

Think of the tribes so dearly bought
With the Redeemer’s blood,
Nor let Thy Zion be forgot,
Where once Thy glory stood.

Where once Thy churches prayed and sang
Thy foes profanely rage;
Amid Thy gates their ensigns hang,
And there their hosts engage.

And still to heighten our distress,
Thy presence is withdrawn;
Thy wonted signs of pow’r and grace,
Thy pow’r and grace are gone.

No prophet speaks to calm our grief,
But all in silence mourn,
Nor know the hour of our relief,
The hour of Thy return.

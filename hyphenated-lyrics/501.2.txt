# O’LEARY

And will the Judge de-scend,
And must the dead a-rise,
And not a sin-gle soul es-cape
His all-dis-cern-ing eyes?

How will my heart en-dure
The ter-rors of that day,
When earth and heav’n be-fore His face
As-ton-ished shrink a-way?

But ere the trum-pet shakes
The man-sions of the dead,
Hark, from the gos-pel’s cheer-ing sound,
What joy-ful tid-ings spread.

And will the Judge descend,
And must the dead arise,
And not a single soul escape
His all-discerning eyes?

How will my heart endure
The terrors of that day,
When earth and heav’n before His face
Astonished shrink away?

But ere the trumpet shakes
The mansions of the dead,
Hark, from the gospel’s cheering sound,
What joyful tidings spread.

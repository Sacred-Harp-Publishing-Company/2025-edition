Dear Lord, what heav’n-ly won-ders dwell
In Thy a-ton-ing blood;
By this are sin-ners snatched from hell
And re-bels brought to God.

O may the sweet, the bliss-ful theme
Fill ev-’ry heart and tongue,
Till strang-ers love Thy charm-ing name,
And join the sa-cred song.

Dear Lord, what heav’nly wonders dwell
In Thy atoning blood;
By this are sinners snatched from hell
And rebels brought to God.

O may the sweet, the blissful theme
Fill ev’ry heart and tongue,
Till strangers love Thy charming name,
And join the sacred song.

# ENOCH

When o-ver-whelmed with grief
My heart with-in me dies,
Help-less, and far from all re-lief,
To heav’n I lift mine eyes.

O lead me to the Rock
That’s high a-bove my head,
And make the cov-ert of thy wings
My shel-ter and my shade.

With-in thy pres-ence, Lord,
For-ev-er I’ll a-bide;
Thou art the tow’r of my de-fense,
The ref-uge where I hide.

When overwhelmed with grief
My heart within me dies,
Helpless, and far from all relief,
To heav’n I lift mine eyes.

O lead me to the Rock
That’s high above my head,
And make the covert of thy wings
My shelter and my shade.

Within thy presence, Lord,
Forever I’ll abide;
Thou art the tow’r of my defense,
The refuge where I hide.

# CHAMBERSBURG

Lo! I be-hold the scat-t’ring shades,
The dawn of heav’n ap-pears;
The sweet im-mor-tal morn-ing spreads
Its blush-es round the spheres.

How will our joy and won-der rise,
When our re-turn-ing King
Shall bear us home-ward through the skies
On love’s tri-um-phant wing!

Lo! I behold the scatt’ring shades,
The dawn of heav’n appears;
The sweet immortal morning spreads
Its blushes round the spheres.

How will our joy and wonder rise,
When our returning King
Shall bear us homeward through the skies
On love’s triumphant wing!

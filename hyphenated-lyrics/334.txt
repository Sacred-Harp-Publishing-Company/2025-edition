“He lead-eth me”—O bless-ed thought!
O words with heav’n-ly com-fort fraught!
What-e’er I do, wher-e’er I be,
Still ’tis God’s hand that lead-eth me.

[chorus]
He lead-eth me, He lead-eth me,
By His own hand He lead-eth me;
His faith-ful fol-l’wer I would be,
For by His hand He lead-eth me.

Some-times mid scenes of deep-est gloom,
Some-times where E-den’s bow-ers bloom,
By wa-ters still, o’er trou-bled sea,
Still ’tis His hand that lead-eth me.

Lord, I would place my hand in Thine,
Nor ev-er mur-mur nor re-pine,
Con-tent, what-ev-er lot I see,
Since ’tis my God that lead-eth me.

And when my task on earth is done,
When by Thy grace the vic-t’ry’s won,
E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jor-dan lead-eth me.

“He leadeth me”—O blessed thought!
O words with heav’nly comfort fraught!
Whate’er I do, where’er I be,
Still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.

[chorus]
He leadeth me, He leadeth me,
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful foll’wer I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.

Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,
By waters still, o’er troubled sea,
Still ’tis His hand that leadeth me.

Lord, I would place my hand in Thine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since ’tis my God that leadeth me.

And when my task on earth is done,
When by Thy grace the vict’ry’s won,
E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

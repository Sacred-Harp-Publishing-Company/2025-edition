How te-dious and taste-less the hours
When Je-sus no long-er I see!
Sweet pros-pects, sweet birds, and sweet flow’rs
Have lost all their sweet-ness to me.

His name yields the sweet-est per-fume,
And sweet-er than mu-sic His voice;
His pres-ence dis-pers-es my gloom,
And makes all with-in me re-joice.

How tedious and tasteless the hours
When Jesus no longer I see!
Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flow’rs
Have lost all their sweetness to me.

His name yields the sweetest perfume,
And sweeter than music His voice;
His presence disperses my gloom,
And makes all within me rejoice.

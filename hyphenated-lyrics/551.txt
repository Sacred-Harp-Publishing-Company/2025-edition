# JACOB’S VISION

As Ja-cob with trav-el was wea-ry one day,
And at night on a stone for a pil-low he lay,
There he saw in a vi-sion a lad-der so high,
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.

[chorus]
Al-le-lu-ia to Je-sus who died on the tree,
And hath raised up a lad-der of mer-cy for me.

The lad-der is long, it is strong and well made,
It stood hun-dreds of years, and is not yet de-cayed;
Man-y mil-lions have climbed it and reached Zi-on’s hill,
And the thou-sands by faith are now climb-ing it still.

Come, let us as-cend! All may climb it who will,
For the an-gels of Ja-cob are guard-ing it still.
There are re-gions of light, there are man-sions of bliss;
Oh, then, who would not climb such a lad-der as this?

As Jacob with travel was weary one day,
And at night on a stone for a pillow he lay,
There he saw in a vision a ladder so high,
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.

[chorus]
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
And hath raised up a ladder of mercy for me.

The ladder is long, it is strong and well made,
It stood hundreds of years, and is not yet decayed;
Many millions have climbed it and reached Zion’s hill,
And the thousands by faith are now climbing it still.

Come, let us ascend! All may climb it who will,
For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still.
There are regions of light, there are mansions of bliss;
Oh, then, who would not climb such a ladder as this?

# EDOM

With songs and hon-ors sound-ing loud,
Ad-dress the Lord on high;
O-ver the heav’ns He spreads His clouds,
And wa-ters veil the sky.
He sends His show’rs of bless-ings down
To cheer the plains be-low;
He makes the grass the moun-tains crown,
And corn in val-leys grow.

With songs and honors sounding loud,
Address the Lord on high;
Over the heav’ns He spreads His clouds,
And waters veil the sky.
He sends His show’rs of blessings down
To cheer the plains below;
He makes the grass the mountains crown,
And corn in valleys grow.

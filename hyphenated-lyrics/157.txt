# ESSAY

See how the wick-ed king-dom
Is fall-ing ev-’ry day!
And still our bless-ed Je-sus
Is win-ning souls a-way;
But oh, how I am tempt-ed,
No mor-tal tongue can tell!
So of-ten I’m sur-round-ed
With en-e-mies from hell.

With weep-ing and with pray-ing,
My Je-sus I have found,
To cru-ci-fy old na-ture,
And make His grace a-bound.
Dear chil-dren, don’t be wea-ry,
But march on in the way;
For Je-sus will stand by you
And be your guard and stay.

If sin-ners will serve Sa-tan,
And join with one ac-cord,
Dear breth-ren, as for my part
I’m bound to serve the Lord;
And if you will go with me,
Pray give to me your hand,
And we’ll march on to-geth-er
Un-to the prom-ised land.

See how the wicked kingdom
Is falling ev’ry day!
And still our blessed Jesus
Is winning souls away;
But oh, how I am tempted,
No mortal tongue can tell!
So often I’m surrounded
With enemies from hell.

With weeping and with praying,
My Jesus I have found,
To crucify old nature,
And make His grace abound.
Dear children, don’t be weary,
But march on in the way;
For Jesus will stand by you
And be your guard and stay.

If sinners will serve Satan,
And join with one accord,
Dear brethren, as for my part
I’m bound to serve the Lord;
And if you will go with me,
Pray give to me your hand,
And we’ll march on together
Unto the promised land.

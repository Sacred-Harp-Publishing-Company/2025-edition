# NEW YORK

When men of mis-chief rise
In se-cret ’gainst the skies,
Thy hand shall sweep them to the grave;
And oh! be-yond the tomb,
How dread-ful is their doom,
Where not a hand is reached to save!

When men of mischief rise
In secret ’gainst the skies,
Thy hand shall sweep them to the grave;
And oh! beyond the tomb,
How dreadful is their doom,
Where not a hand is reached to save!

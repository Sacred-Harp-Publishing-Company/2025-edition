# NEW BETHANY

Ere moun-tains reared their forms sub-lime,
Or heav’n and earth in or-der stood,
Be-fore the birth of an-cient times,
From ev-er-last-ing Thou art God.

Ere mountains reared their forms sublime,
Or heav’n and earth in order stood,
Before the birth of ancient times,
From everlasting Thou art God.

Far from my thoughts, vain world, be gone!
Let my re-li-gious hours a-lone:
Fain would my eyes my Sav-ior see;
I wait a vis-it, Lord, from Thee.

My heart grows warm with ho-ly fire,
And kin-dles with a pure de-sire.
Come, my dear Je-sus, from a-bove,
And feed my soul with heav’n-ly love.

Blest Je-sus, what de-li-cious fare!
How sweet Thine en-ter-tain-ments are!
Nev-er did an-gels taste a-bove
Re-deem-ing grace and dy-ing love.

Far from my thoughts, vain world, be gone!
Let my religious hours alone:
Fain would my eyes my Savior see;
I wait a visit, Lord, from Thee.

My heart grows warm with holy fire,
And kindles with a pure desire.
Come, my dear Jesus, from above,
And feed my soul with heav’nly love.

Blest Jesus, what delicious fare!
How sweet Thine entertainments are!
Never did angels taste above
Redeeming grace and dying love.

# MY LIFE AND BREATH

He saw me sink-ing in dis-tress,
And flew to my re-lief;
For me He bore the shame-ful cross,
And car-ried all my grief.

[chorus]
To Him I owe my life and breath
And all the joys I have;
He makes me tri-umph o-ver death,
And saves me from the grave.

To heav’n, the place of His a-bode,
He brings my wea-ry feet,
Shows me the glo-ries of my God,
And makes my joys com-plete.

------

He saw me sinking in distress,
And flew to my relief;
For me He bore the shameful cross,
And carried all my grief.

[chorus]
To Him I owe my life and breath
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
And saves me from the grave.

To heav’n, the place of His abode,
He brings my weary feet,
Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joys complete.

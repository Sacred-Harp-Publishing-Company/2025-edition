Lord, in the morn-ing Thou shalt hear
My voice as-cend-ing high;
To Thee will I di-rect my prayer,
To Thee lift up mine eye.

O may the Spir-it guide my feet
In ways of right-eous-ness!
Make ev-’ry path of du-ty straight
And plain be-fore my face.

Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear
My voice ascending high;
To Thee will I direct my prayer,
To Thee lift up mine eye.

O may the Spirit guide my feet
In ways of righteousness!
Make ev’ry path of duty straight
And plain before my face.

Poor and af-flict-ed, Lord, are Thine,
A-mong the great un-fit to shine;
But though the world may think it strange,
They would not with the world ex-change.

Poor and af-flict-ed, yet they trust
In God, the gra-cious, wise, and just;
For them He deigns this lot to choose,
Nor would they dare His will re-fuse.

Poor and af-flict-ed, yet they sing,
For Christ, their glo-rious, con-qu’ring King,
Through suf-f’rings per-fect, reigns on high,
And does their ev-’ry need sup-ply.

Poor and afflicted, Lord, are Thine,
Among the great unfit to shine;
But though the world may think it strange,
They would not with the world exchange.

Poor and afflicted, yet they trust
In God, the gracious, wise, and just;
For them He deigns this lot to choose,
Nor would they dare His will refuse.

Poor and afflicted, yet they sing,
For Christ, their glorious, conqu’ring King,
Through suff’rings perfect, reigns on high,
And does their ev’ry need supply.

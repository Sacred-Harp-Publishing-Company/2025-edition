# BLOOMING YOUTH

In the bright sea-son of thy youth,
In na-ture’s smil-ing bloom,
Ere age ar-rives, and trem-bling waits
Its sum-mons to the tomb.

Re-mem-ber thy Cre-a-tor, God;
For Him thy pow’rs em-ploy;
Make Him thy fear, thy love, thy hope,
Thy por-tion and thy joy.

The Lord will safe-ly guide thy course
O’er life’s un-cer-tain sea,
And bring thee to the peace-ful shore,
The heav’n pre-pared for thee.

------

In the bright season of thy youth,
In nature’s smiling bloom,
Ere age arrives, and trembling waits
Its summons to the tomb.

Remember thy Creator, God;
For Him thy pow’rs employ;
Make Him thy fear, thy love, thy hope,
Thy portion and thy joy.

The Lord will safely guide thy course
O’er life’s uncertain sea,
And bring thee to the peaceful shore,
The heav’n prepared for thee.

# BABEL’S STREAMS

By Ba-bel’s streams we sat and wept,
While Zi-on we thought on;
A-midst there-of we hung our harps
The wil-low trees up-on.
With all the pow’r and skill I have,
I’ll gen-tly touch each string;
If I can reach the charm-ing sound,
I’ll tune my harp a-gain.

By Babel’s streams we sat and wept,
While Zion we thought on;
Amidst thereof we hung our harps
The willow trees upon.
With all the pow’r and skill I have,
I’ll gently touch each string;
If I can reach the charming sound,
I’ll tune my harp again.

# RESTORATION

Come, Thou Fount of ev-’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mer-cy, nev-er ceas-ing,
Call for songs of loud-est praise.

[chorus]
I will rise and go to Je-sus,
He’ll em-brace me in His arms;
In the arms of my dear Sav-ior,
O there are ten thou-sand charms.

Teach me some me-lo-dious son-net,
Sung by flam-ing tongues a-bove;
Praise the mount—O fix me on it—
Mount of God’s un-chang-ing love.

Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

[chorus]
I will rise and go to Jesus,
He’ll embrace me in His arms;
In the arms of my dear Savior,
O there are ten thousand charms.

Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above;
Praise the mount—O fix me on it—
Mount of God’s unchanging love.

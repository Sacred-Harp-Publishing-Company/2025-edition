# DONE WITH THE WORLD

Je-sus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
And I don’t ex-pect to stay much long-er here.
He whom I fix my hopes up-on,
And I don’t ex-pect to stay much long-er here.

[chorus]
I am done with the world, and I want to serve the Lord,
And I don’t ex-pect to stay much long-er here.

------

Jesus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
And I don’t expect to stay much longer here.
He whom I fix my hopes upon,
And I don’t expect to stay much longer here.

[chorus]
I am done with the world, and I want to serve the Lord,
And I don’t expect to stay much longer here.

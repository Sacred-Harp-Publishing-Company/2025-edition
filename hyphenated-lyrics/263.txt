# EVERY GRACE

My Sav-ior and my King,
Thy beau-ties are di-vine;
Thy lips with bless-ings o-ver-flow,
And ev-’ry grace is Thine.

The smil-ings of Thy face,
How a-mia-ble they are!
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine em-brace,
And no-where else but there.

My Savior and my King,
Thy beauties are divine;
Thy lips with blessings overflow,
And ev’ry grace is Thine.

The smilings of Thy face,
How amiable they are!
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine embrace,
And nowhere else but there.

For-ev-er bless-ed be the Lord,
My Sav-ior and my shield;
He sends His Spir-it with His word,
To arm me for the field.

A friend and help-er so di-vine
Doth my weak cour-age raise;
He makes the glo-rious vic-t’ry mine,
And His shall be the praise.

Forever blessed be the Lord,
My Savior and my shield;
He sends His Spirit with His word,
To arm me for the field.

A friend and helper so divine
Doth my weak courage raise;
He makes the glorious vict’ry mine,
And His shall be the praise.

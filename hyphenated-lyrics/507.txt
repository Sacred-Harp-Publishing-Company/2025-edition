# WOODLANDS

Life is a span, a fleet-ing hour;
How soon the va-por flies!
Man is a ten-der, tran-sient flow’r,
That e’en in bloom-ing dies.
The once-loved form, now cold and dead,
Each mourn-ful thought em-ploys;
And na-ture weeps, her com-forts fled,
And with-ered all her joys.

But wait the in-ter-pos-ing gloom,
And lo! stern win-ter flies;
And dressed in beau-ty’s fair-est bloom,
The flow-’ry tribes a-rise.
Hope looks be-yond the bounds of time,
When what we now de-plore
Shall rise in full im-mor-tal prime
And bloom to fade no more.

Life is a span, a fleeting hour;
How soon the vapor flies!
Man is a tender, transient flow’r,
That e’en in blooming dies.
The once-loved form, now cold and dead,
Each mournful thought employs;
And nature weeps, her comforts fled,
And withered all her joys.

But wait the interposing gloom,
And lo! stern winter flies;
And dressed in beauty’s fairest bloom,
The flow’ry tribes arise.
Hope looks beyond the bounds of time,
When what we now deplore
Shall rise in full immortal prime
And bloom to fade no more.

Be-hold the love, the gen-’rous love
That ho-ly Da-vid shows;
Be-hold his kind com-pas-sion move
For his af-flict-ed foes!
When they are sick, his soul com-plains
And seems to feel the smart;
The spir-it of the gos-pel reigns
And melts his pi-ous heart.

How did his flow-ing tears con-dole,
As for a broth-er dead,
And fast-ing mor-ti-fied his soul
While for their lives he prayed!
They groaned and cursed him on their bed,
Yet still he pleads and mourns;
And dou-ble bless-ings on his head
The right-eous Lord re-turns.

O glo-rious type of heav’n-ly grace!
Thus Christ the Lord ap-pears;
While sin-ners curse, the Sav-ior prays
And pit-ies them with tears.
He the true Da-vid, Is-rael’s King,
Blest and be-loved of God,
To save us re-bels dead in sin
Paid His own dear-est blood.

Behold the love, the gen’rous love
That holy David shows;
Behold his kind compassion move
For his afflicted foes!
When they are sick, his soul complains
And seems to feel the smart;
The spirit of the gospel reigns
And melts his pious heart.

How did his flowing tears condole,
As for a brother dead,
And fasting mortified his soul
While for their lives he prayed!
They groaned and cursed him on their bed,
Yet still he pleads and mourns;
And double blessings on his head
The righteous Lord returns.

O glorious type of heav’nly grace!
Thus Christ the Lord appears;
While sinners curse, the Savior prays
And pities them with tears.
He the true David, Israel’s King,
Blest and beloved of God,
To save us rebels dead in sin
Paid His own dearest blood.

# SPAN OF LIFE

My span of life will soon be gone,
The pass-ing mo-ments say,
As length-’ning shad-ows o’er the mead
Pro-claim the close of day.
O that my heart might dwell a-loof
From all cre-at-ed things,
And learn that wis-dom from a-bove
Whence true con-tent-ment springs.

Ere first I drew this vi-tal breath,
From na-ture’s pris-on free,
Cross-es in num-ber, meas-ure, weight,
Were writ-ten, Lord, for me.
But Thou, my Shep-herd, Friend, and Guide,
Hast kind-ly led me on,
Taught me to rest my faint-ing head
On Christ, the Cor-ner-stone.

So com-fort-ed and so sus-tained,
With dark e-vents I strove,
And found them right-ly un-der-stood,
All mes-sen-gers of love;
With si-lent and sub-mis-sive awe,
A-dored a chast-’ning God,
Re-vered the ter-rors of His law,
And hum-bly kissed the rod.

My span of life will soon be gone,
The passing moments say,
As length’ning shadows o’er the mead
Proclaim the close of day.
O that my heart might dwell aloof
From all created things,
And learn that wisdom from above
Whence true contentment springs.

Ere first I drew this vital breath,
From nature’s prison free,
Crosses in number, measure, weight,
Were written, Lord, for me.
But Thou, my Shepherd, Friend, and Guide,
Hast kindly led me on,
Taught me to rest my fainting head
On Christ, the Cornerstone.

So comforted and so sustained,
With dark events I strove,
And found them rightly understood,
All messengers of love;
With silent and submissive awe,
Adored a chast’ning God,
Revered the terrors of His law,
And humbly kissed the rod.

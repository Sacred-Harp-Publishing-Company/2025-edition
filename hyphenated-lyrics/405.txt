# THE MARCELLAS

Chil-dren of the heav’n-ly King,
As we jour-ney, sweet-ly sing;
Sing your Sav-ior’s wor-thy praise,
Glo-rious in His works and ways.

Fear not, breth-ren—joy-ful stand
On the bor-ders of your land;
Je-sus Christ, your Fa-ther’s Son,
Bids you un-dis-mayed go on.

Lord, sub-mis-sive make us go,
Glad-ly leav-ing all be-low;
On-ly Thou our lead-er be,
And we still will fol-low Thee.

------

Children of the heav’nly King,
As we journey, sweetly sing;
Sing your Savior’s worthy praise,
Glorious in His works and ways.

Fear not, brethren—joyful stand
On the borders of your land;
Jesus Christ, your Father’s Son,
Bids you undismayed go on.

Lord, submissive make us go,
Gladly leaving all below;
Only Thou our leader be,
And we still will follow Thee.

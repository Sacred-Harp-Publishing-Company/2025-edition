# DISTRESS

So fades the love-ly bloom-ing flow’r,
Frail, smil-ing sol-ace of an hour;
So soon our tran-sient com-forts fly,
And pleas-ure on-ly blooms to die.

Is there no kind, no heal-ing art
To soothe the an-guish of the heart?
Spir-it of grace, be ev-er nigh;
Thy com-forts are not made to die.

Let gen-tle pa-tience smile on pain,
Till dy-ing hope re-vives a-gain;
Hope wipes the tear from sor-row’s eye,
And faith points up-ward to the sky.

So fades the lovely blooming flow’r,
Frail, smiling solace of an hour;
So soon our transient comforts fly,
And pleasure only blooms to die.

Is there no kind, no healing art
To soothe the anguish of the heart?
Spirit of grace, be ever nigh;
Thy comforts are not made to die.

Let gentle patience smile on pain,
Till dying hope revives again;
Hope wipes the tear from sorrow’s eye,
And faith points upward to the sky.

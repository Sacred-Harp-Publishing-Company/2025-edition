Fare-well, dear breth-ren of the Lord!
And I can-not tar-ry here;
Yet we be-lieve His gra-cious word,
And I can-not tar-ry here.

[chorus]
And I can-not tar-ry here,
And I can-not tar-ry here;
The gos-pel sounds the ju-bi-lee,
And I can-not tar-ry here.

------

Farewell, dear brethren of the Lord!
And I cannot tarry here;
Yet we believe His gracious word,
And I cannot tarry here.

[chorus]
And I cannot tarry here,
And I cannot tarry here;
The gospel sounds the jubilee,
And I cannot tarry here.

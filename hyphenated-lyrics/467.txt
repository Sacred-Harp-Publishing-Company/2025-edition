Wel-come, sweet day of rest,
That saw the Lord a-rise;
Wel-come to this re-viv-ing breast
And these re-joic-ing eyes.

My will-ing soul would stay
In such a frame as this,
And sit and sing her-self a-way
To ev-er-last-ing bliss.

------

Welcome, sweet day of rest,
That saw the Lord arise;
Welcome to this reviving breast
And these rejoicing eyes.

My willing soul would stay
In such a frame as this,
And sit and sing herself away
To everlasting bliss.

Ye flow-’ry plains, pro-claim His skill;
Val-leys lie low be-fore His eye;
And let His praise from ev-’ry hill
Rise tune-ful to the neigh-b’ring sky.

Speak of the won-ders of that love
Which Ga-briel plays on ev-’ry chord:
From all be-low, and all a-bove,
Loud hal-le-lu-jahs to the Lord.

Ye flow’ry plains, proclaim His skill;
Valleys lie low before His eye;
And let His praise from ev’ry hill
Rise tuneful to the neighb’ring sky.

Speak of the wonders of that love
Which Gabriel plays on ev’ry chord:
From all below, and all above,
Loud hallelujahs to the Lord.

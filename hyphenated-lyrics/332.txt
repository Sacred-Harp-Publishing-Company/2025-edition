# SONS OF SORROW

Hail, ye sigh-ing sons of sor-row,
Learn with me your cer-tain doom;
Learn with me your fate to-mor-row—
Dead, per-haps, laid in the tomb!
See all na-ture fad-ing, dy-ing—
Si-lent, all things seem to mourn;
Life from veg-e-ta-tion fly-ing,
Calls to mind the mold-’ring urn.

Oft the au-tumn tem-pest ris-ing
Makes the loft-y for-est nod;
Scenes of na-ture, how sur-pris-ing,
Read in na-ture, Na-ture’s God.
And our sov-’reign sole Cre-a-tor
Lives e-ter-nal in the sky,
While we mor-tals yield to na-ture,
Bloom a-while, then fade and die.

Fast my sun of life’s de-clin-ing,
Soon ’twill set in dis-mal night;
But my hopes, pure and re-fin-ing,
Rest in fu-ture life and light.
Cease then trem-bling, fear-ing, sigh-ing:
Death will break the sul-len gloom;
Soon my spir-it, flut-t’ring, fly-ing,
Shall be borne be-yond the tomb.

Hail, ye sighing sons of sorrow,
Learn with me your certain doom;
Learn with me your fate tomorrow—
Dead, perhaps, laid in the tomb!
See all nature fading, dying—
Silent, all things seem to mourn;
Life from vegetation flying,
Calls to mind the mold’ring urn.

Oft the autumn tempest rising
Makes the lofty forest nod;
Scenes of nature, how surprising,
Read in nature, Nature’s God.
And our sov’reign sole Creator
Lives eternal in the sky,
While we mortals yield to nature,
Bloom awhile, then fade and die.

Fast my sun of life’s declining,
Soon ’twill set in dismal night;
But my hopes, pure and refining,
Rest in future life and light.
Cease then trembling, fearing, sighing:
Death will break the sullen gloom;
Soon my spirit, flutt’ring, flying,
Shall be borne beyond the tomb.

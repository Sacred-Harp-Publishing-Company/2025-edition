# AMSTERDAM

Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
Thy bet-ter por-tion trace;
Rise from all ter-res-trial things
Towards heav’n, thy na-tive place.
Sun and moon and stars de-cay,
Time shall soon this earth re-move;
Rise, my soul, and haste a-way
To seats pre-pared a-bove.

Riv-ers to the o-cean run,
Nor stay in all their course;
Fire, as-cend-ing, seeks the sun;
Both speed them to their source;
So a soul that’s born of God
Pants to view His glo-rious face;
Up-wards tends to His a-bode
To rest in His em-brace.

Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
Thy better portion trace;
Rise from all terrestrial things
Towards heav’n, thy native place.
Sun and moon and stars decay,
Time shall soon this earth remove;
Rise, my soul, and haste away
To seats prepared above.

Rivers to the ocean run,
Nor stay in all their course;
Fire, ascending, seeks the sun;
Both speed them to their source;
So a soul that’s born of God
Pants to view His glorious face;
Upwards tends to His abode
To rest in His embrace.

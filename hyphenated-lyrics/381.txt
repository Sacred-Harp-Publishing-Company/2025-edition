# WELLS SECOND

There is a house not made with hands,
E-ter-nal and on high;
And here my spir-it wait-ing stands,
Till God shall bid it fly.

Short-ly this pris-on of my clay
Must be dis-solved and fall;
Then, O my soul, with joy o-bey
Thy heav’n-ly Fa-ther’s call.

I long to see my friends a-gain,
And hear them sweet-ly say:
“Come, wea-ry dove, here is thy home,
Then fold thy wings and stay.”

There is a house not made with hands,
Eternal and on high;
And here my spirit waiting stands,
Till God shall bid it fly.

Shortly this prison of my clay
Must be dissolved and fall;
Then, O my soul, with joy obey
Thy heav’nly Father’s call.

I long to see my friends again,
And hear them sweetly say:
“Come, weary dove, here is thy home,
Then fold thy wings and stay.”

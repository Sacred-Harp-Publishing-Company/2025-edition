Hark! from the tombs a dole-ful sound;
Mine ears, at-tend the cry,
“Ye liv-ing men, come view the ground
Where you must short-ly lie.”

[verse 1 chorus]
Where you must short-ly lie,
Where you must short-ly lie,
Ye liv-ing men, come view the ground
Where you must short-ly lie.

“Prin-ces, this clay must be your bed,
In spite of all your tow’rs;
The tall, the wise, the rev-’rend head
Must lie as low as ours.”

[verse 2 chorus]
Must lie as low as ours,
Must lie as low as ours,
The tall, the wise, the rev-’rend head
Must lie as low as ours.

Great God! is this our cer-tain doom?
And are we still se-cure?
Still walk-ing down-ward to the tomb,
And yet pre-pared no more!

[verse 3 chorus]
And yet pre-pared no more,
And yet pre-pared no more,
Still walk-ing down-ward to the tomb,
And yet pre-pared no more!

Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound;
Mine ears, attend the cry,
“Ye living men, come view the ground
Where you must shortly lie.”

[verse 1 chorus]
Where you must shortly lie,
Where you must shortly lie,
Ye living men, come view the ground
Where you must shortly lie.

“Princes, this clay must be your bed,
In spite of all your tow’rs;
The tall, the wise, the rev’rend head
Must lie as low as ours.”

[verse 2 chorus]
Must lie as low as ours,
Must lie as low as ours,
The tall, the wise, the rev’rend head
Must lie as low as ours.

Great God! is this our certain doom?
And are we still secure?
Still walking downward to the tomb,
And yet prepared no more!

[verse 3 chorus]
And yet prepared no more,
And yet prepared no more,
Still walking downward to the tomb,
And yet prepared no more!

# SIMENA

May peace at-tend thy gate,
And joy with-in thee wait,
To bless the soul of ev-’ry guest;
The man that seeks thy peace,
And wish-es thine in-crease,
A thou-sand bless-ings on him rest.

My tongue re-peats her vows,
“Peace to this sa-cred house!”
For there my friends and kin-dred dwell;
And since my glo-rious God
Makes thee His blest a-bode,
My soul shall ev-er love thee well.

May peace attend thy gate,
And joy within thee wait,
To bless the soul of ev’ry guest;
The man that seeks thy peace,
And wishes thine increase,
A thousand blessings on him rest.

My tongue repeats her vows,
“Peace to this sacred house!”
For there my friends and kindred dwell;
And since my glorious God
Makes thee His blest abode,
My soul shall ever love thee well.

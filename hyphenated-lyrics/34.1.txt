# THE GOSPEL POOL

Be-side the gos-pel pool,
Ap-point-ed for the poor,
From time to time my help-less soul
Has wait-ed for a cure.

But whith-er can I go?
There is no oth-er pool
Where streams of sov-’reign vir-tue flow
To make a sin-ner whole.

------

Beside the gospel pool,
Appointed for the poor,
From time to time my helpless soul
Has waited for a cure.

But whither can I go?
There is no other pool
Where streams of sov’reign virtue flow
To make a sinner whole.

# HELEN HILLS HILLS

Ah! whith-er can I go,
Bur-dened and sick and faint?
To whom should I my trou-bles show,
And pour out my com-plaint?

Come and pos-sess me whole,
Nor hence a-gain re-move;
Oh, come and fix my wav-’ring soul
With all Thy weight of love.

Ah! whither can I go,
Burdened and sick and faint?
To whom should I my troubles show,
And pour out my complaint?

Come and possess me whole,
Nor hence again remove;
Oh, come and fix my wav’ring soul
With all Thy weight of love.

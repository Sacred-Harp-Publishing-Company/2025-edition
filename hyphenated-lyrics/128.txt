# THE PROMISED LAND

On Jor-dan’s storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a wish-ful eye
To Ca-naan’s fair and hap-py land
Where my pos-ses-sions lie.

[chorus]
I am bound for the prom-ised land,
I’m bound for the prom-ised land,
Oh, who will come and go with me,
I am bound for the prom-ised land.

Oh, the trans-port-ing, rap-t’rous scene
That ris-es to my sight!
Sweet fields ar-rayed in liv-ing green,
And riv-ers of de-light.

Filled with de-light, my rap-tured soul
Would here no long-er stay;
Though Jor-dan’s waves a-round me roll,
Fear-less I’d launch a-way.

------

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.

[chorus]
I am bound for the promised land,
I’m bound for the promised land,
Oh, who will come and go with me,
I am bound for the promised land.

Oh, the transporting, rapt’rous scene
That rises to my sight!
Sweet fields arrayed in living green,
And rivers of delight.

Filled with delight, my raptured soul
Would here no longer stay;
Though Jordan’s waves around me roll,
Fearless I’d launch away.

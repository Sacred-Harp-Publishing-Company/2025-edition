# INVITATION

Hark! the Re-deem-er, from on high,
Sweet-ly in-vites His fav-’rites nigh,
From caves of dark-ness and of doubt,
He gen-tly speaks and calls us out:
“Come, my be-lov-ed, haste a-way,
Cut short the hours of thy de-lay;
Fly like a youth-ful hart or roe,
O-ver the hills where spic-es grow.”

Hark! the Redeemer, from on high,
Sweetly invites His fav’rites nigh,
From caves of darkness and of doubt,
He gently speaks and calls us out:
“Come, my beloved, haste away,
Cut short the hours of thy delay;
Fly like a youthful hart or roe,
Over the hills where spices grow.”

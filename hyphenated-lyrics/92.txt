The glo-rious light of Zi-on
Is spread-ing far and wide,
And sin-ners now are com-ing
Un-to the gos-pel tide.

[chorus]
To see the saints in glo-ry,
And the an-gels stand in-vit-ing
To wel-come sin-ners home.

The glo-ry of King Je-sus
Tri-um-phant doth a-rise,
And sin-ners crowd a-round it
With bit-ter groans and cries.

------

The glorious light of Zion
Is spreading far and wide,
And sinners now are coming
Unto the gospel tide.

[chorus]
To see the saints in glory,
And the angels stand inviting
To welcome sinners home.

The glory of King Jesus
Triumphant doth arise,
And sinners crowd around it
With bitter groans and cries.

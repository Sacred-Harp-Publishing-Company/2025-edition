# WONDROUS LOVE

What won-drous love is this! oh, my soul! oh, my soul!
What won-drous love is this! oh, my soul!
What won-drous love is this
That caused the Lord of bliss
To bear the dread-ful curse for my soul, for my soul,
To bear the dread-ful curse for my soul.

When I was sink-ing down, sink-ing down, sink-ing down,
When I was sink-ing down, sink-ing down,
When I was sink-ing down
Be-neath God’s right-eous frown
Christ laid a-side His crown for my soul, for my soul,
Christ laid a-side His crown for my soul.

To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing,
To God and to the Lamb I will sing,
To God and to the Lamb,
Who is the great I Am,
While mil-lions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing,
While mil-lions join the theme, I will sing.

And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on,
And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on,
And when from death I’m free,
I’ll sing and joy-ful be;
Through-out e-ter-ni-ty, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on,
Through-out e-ter-ni-ty, I’ll sing on.

What wondrous love is this! oh, my soul! oh, my soul!
What wondrous love is this! oh, my soul!
What wondrous love is this
That caused the Lord of bliss
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul,
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul.

When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down,
When I was sinking down, sinking down,
When I was sinking down
Beneath God’s righteous frown
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul, for my soul,
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul.

To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing,
To God and to the Lamb I will sing,
To God and to the Lamb,
Who is the great I Am,
While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing,
While millions join the theme, I will sing.

And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on,
And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on,
And when from death I’m free,
I’ll sing and joyful be;
Throughout eternity, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on,
Throughout eternity, I’ll sing on.

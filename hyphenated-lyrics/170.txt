# EXHILARATION

O may I wor-thy prove to see
The saints in full pros-per-i-ty.
Then my trou-bles will be o-ver.
To see the bride, the glit-t’ring bride,
Close seat-ed by my Sav-ior’s side.
Then my trou-bles will be o-ver.

[chorus]
I nev-er shall for-get the day
When Je-sus washed my sins a-way,
And then my trou-bles will be o-ver,
Will be o-ver,
Will be o-ver,
And re-joic-ing,
And then my trou-bles will be o-ver.

I’ll praise Him while He gives me breath,
I hope to praise Him af-ter death.
Then my trou-bles will be o-ver.
I hope to praise Him when I die,
And shout sal-va-tion as I fly!
Then my trou-bles will be o-ver.

I soon shall pass the vale of death,
And in His arms re-sign my breath.
Then my trou-bles will be o-ver.
O then my hap-py soul shall tell
My Je-sus has done all things well.
Then my trou-bles will be o-ver.

O may I worthy prove to see
The saints in full prosperity.
Then my troubles will be over.
To see the bride, the glitt’ring bride,
Close seated by my Savior’s side.
Then my troubles will be over.

[chorus]
I never shall forget the day
When Jesus washed my sins away,
And then my troubles will be over,
Will be over,
Will be over,
And rejoicing,
And then my troubles will be over.

I’ll praise Him while He gives me breath,
I hope to praise Him after death.
Then my troubles will be over.
I hope to praise Him when I die,
And shout salvation as I fly!
Then my troubles will be over.

I soon shall pass the vale of death,
And in His arms resign my breath.
Then my troubles will be over.
O then my happy soul shall tell
My Jesus has done all things well.
Then my troubles will be over.

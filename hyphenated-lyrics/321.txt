Vain man, thy fond pur-suits for-bear;
Re-pent, thy end is nigh!
Death at the far-thest can’t be far;
O think be-fore thou die!
Re-flect: thou hast a soul to save;
Thy sins, how high they mount!
What are thy hopes be-yond the grave?
How stands that dark ac-count?

Vain man, thy fond pursuits forbear;
Repent, thy end is nigh!
Death at the farthest can’t be far;
O think before thou die!
Reflect: thou hast a soul to save;
Thy sins, how high they mount!
What are thy hopes beyond the grave?
How stands that dark account?

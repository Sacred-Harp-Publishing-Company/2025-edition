# MELANCHOLY DAY

Death, ’tis a mel-an-chol-y day
To those who have no God,
When the poor soul is forced a-way
To seek her last a-bode.
In vain to heav’n she lifts her eyes,
For guilt, a heav-y chain,
Still drags her down-ward from the skies
To dark-ness, fire, and pain.

Death, ’tis a melancholy day
To those who have no God,
When the poor soul is forced away
To seek her last abode.
In vain to heav’n she lifts her eyes,
For guilt, a heavy chain,
Still drags her downward from the skies
To darkness, fire, and pain.

# A GLAD NEW SONG

I’ve learned to sing a glad new song
Of praise un-to our King!
And now with all my ran-somed pow’rs
His prais-es I will sing.
I’ve learned to sing the song of peace;
’Tis sweet-er ev-’ry day,
Since Je-sus calmed my trou-bled soul,
And bore my sins a-way.

I’ve learned to sing the song of joy;
My cup is run-ning o’er
With bless-ings full of peace and love,
And still there’s more and more.
Soon I shall sing the glad new song
Of Mo-ses and the Lamb,
With all the saint-ed hosts a-bove,
Be-fore the great I Am.

I’ve learned to sing a glad new song
Of praise unto our King!
And now with all my ransomed pow’rs
His praises I will sing.
I’ve learned to sing the song of peace;
’Tis sweeter ev’ry day,
Since Jesus calmed my troubled soul,
And bore my sins away.

I’ve learned to sing the song of joy;
My cup is running o’er
With blessings full of peace and love,
And still there’s more and more.
Soon I shall sing the glad new song
Of Moses and the Lamb,
With all the sainted hosts above,
Before the great I Am.

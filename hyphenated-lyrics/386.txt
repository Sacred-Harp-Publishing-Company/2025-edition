# CHRIST OUR SONG

A-wake, my heart, a-rise, my tongue,
Pre-pare a tune-ful voice;
In God, the life of all my joys,
A-loud will I re-joice.
When I ap-pear in yon-der cloud
With all the sa-cred throng,
Then will I sing more sweet, more loud,
And Christ will be my song.

------

Awake, my heart, arise, my tongue,
Prepare a tuneful voice;
In God, the life of all my joys,
Aloud will I rejoice.
When I appear in yonder cloud
With all the sacred throng,
Then will I sing more sweet, more loud,
And Christ will be my song.

# CONVERTING GRACE

As pants the hart for cool-ing streams
When heat-ed in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
And Thy re-fresh-ing grace.
Oh, for con-vert-ing grace, and oh,
For sanc-ti-fy-ing pow’r;
Lord, we ask in Je-sus’ name,
A sweet, re-fresh-ing show’r.

For Thee, my God, the liv-ing God,
My thirst-y soul doth pine;
Oh, when shall I be-hold Thy face,
Thy maj-es-ty di-vine?
Why rest-less, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still, and thou shalt sing
Praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health’s e-ter-nal spring.

As pants the hart for cooling streams
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
And Thy refreshing grace.
Oh, for converting grace, and oh,
For sanctifying pow’r;
Lord, we ask in Jesus’ name,
A sweet, refreshing show’r.

For Thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine;
Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,
Thy majesty divine?
Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still, and thou shalt sing
Praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health’s eternal spring.

# HARPETH VALLEY

Where pro-phet’s word and mar-tyr’s blood
And prayers of saints were sown,
We to their la-bors en-t’ring in
Would reap where they have strown.

O Thou whose call our hearts has stirred!
To do Thy will we come,
Thrust in our sick-les at Thy word
And bear our har-vest home.

Where prophet’s word and martyr’s blood
And prayers of saints were sown,
We to their labors ent’ring in
Would reap where they have strown.

O Thou whose call our hearts has stirred!
To do Thy will we come,
Thrust in our sickles at Thy word
And bear our harvest home.

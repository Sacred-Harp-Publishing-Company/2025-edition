There is a song of tri-umph
They sing up-on that shore,
That Je-sus has re-deemed us
To suf-fer nev-er-more.

Then cast-ing our eyes back-ward
Up-on the race we’ve run,
We’ll shout a-loud, Ho-san-na,
De-liv-er-ance has come!

There is a song of triumph
They sing upon that shore,
That Jesus has redeemed us
To suffer nevermore.

Then casting our eyes backward
Upon the race we’ve run,
We’ll shout aloud, Hosanna,
Deliverance has come!

Ho-san-na to the Prince of Light
That clothed Him-self in clay,
En-tered the i-ron gates of death,
And tore the bars a-way.

Be-hold, the Con-qu’ror mounts a-loft,
And to His Fa-ther flies,
With scars of hon-or in His flesh
And tri-umph in His eyes.

Hosanna to the Prince of Light
That clothed Himself in clay,
Entered the iron gates of death,
And tore the bars away.

Behold, the Conqu’ror mounts aloft,
And to His Father flies,
With scars of honor in His flesh
And triumph in His eyes.

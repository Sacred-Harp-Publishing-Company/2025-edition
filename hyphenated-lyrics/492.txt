# INVOCATION

A-rise, my soul, my joy-ful pow’rs,
And tri-umph in my God;
A-wake, my voice,
And loud pro-claim His work;
A-rise, my soul, a-wake, my voice,
And let all tunes of pleas-ure sing;
Loud hal-le-lu-jahs shall ad-dress
The hon-ors of her King.

------

Arise, my soul, my joyful pow’rs,
And triumph in my God;
Awake, my voice,
And loud proclaim His work;
Arise, my soul, awake, my voice,
And let all tunes of pleasure sing;
Loud hallelujahs shall address
The honors of her King.

# CORINTH

Je-sus! and shall it ev-er be,
A mor-tal man a-shamed of Thee?
A-shamed of Thee whom an-gels praise,
Whose glo-ries shine through end-less days.

A-shamed of Je-sus! just as soon
Let mid-night be a-shamed of noon;
’Tis mid-night with my soul till He,
Bright morn-ing star, bids dark-ness flee.

A-shamed of Je-sus! soon-er far
Let eve-ning blush to own a star;
He sheds the beams of light di-vine
O’er this be-night-ed soul of mine.

A-shamed of Je-sus, that dear Friend
On whom my hopes of heav’n de-pend!
No, when I blush, be this my shame,
That I no more re-vere His name.

------

Jesus! and shall it ever be,
A mortal man ashamed of Thee?
Ashamed of Thee whom angels praise,
Whose glories shine through endless days.

Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon
Let midnight be ashamed of noon;
’Tis midnight with my soul till He,
Bright morning star, bids darkness flee.

Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far
Let evening blush to own a star;
He sheds the beams of light divine
O’er this benighted soul of mine.

Ashamed of Jesus, that dear Friend
On whom my hopes of heav’n depend!
No, when I blush, be this my shame,
That I no more revere His name.

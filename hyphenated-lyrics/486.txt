# BENEFICENCE

That man is blest who stands in awe
Of God, and loves His sa-cred law:
His seed on earth shall be re-nowned
And with suc-ces-sive hon-ors crowned.
His house a seat of wealth shall be,
An un-ex-haust-ed treas-ur-y;
His jus-tice, free from all de-cay,
Shall bless-ings to his heirs con-vey.

And with successive honors crowned.
His house a seat of wealth shall be,
An unexhausted treasury;
His justice, free from all decay,
Shall blessings to his heirs convey.

# KEDRON

Thou Man of grief, re-mem-ber me,
Who nev-er canst Thy-self for-get
Thy last ex-pir-ing ag-o-ny,
Thy faint-ing pangs and blood-y sweat.

Fa-ther, if I may call Thee so,
Re-gard my fear-ful heart’s de-sire;
Re-move this load of guilt-y woe,
Nor let me in my sins ex-pire!

I trem-ble, lest the wrath di-vine,
Which bruis-es now my wretch-ed soul,
Should bruise this wretch-ed soul of mine
Long as e-ter-nal ag-es roll.

Thou Man of grief, remember me,
Who never canst Thyself forget
Thy last expiring agony,
Thy fainting pangs and bloody sweat.

Father, if I may call Thee so,
Regard my fearful heart’s desire;
Remove this load of guilty woe,
Nor let me in my sins expire!

I tremble, lest the wrath divine,
Which bruises now my wretched soul,
Should bruise this wretched soul of mine
Long as eternal ages roll.

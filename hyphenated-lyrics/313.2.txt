Rise, rise, my soul, and leave the ground;
Stretch all thy thoughts a-broad,
And rouse up ev-’ry tune-ful sound
To praise th’e-ter-nal God.

Crea-tures with all their end-less race
Thy pow’r and praise pro-claim;
But saints that taste Thy rich-er grace
De-light to bless Thy name.

Rise, rise, my soul, and leave the ground;
Stretch all thy thoughts abroad,
And rouse up ev’ry tuneful sound
To praise th’eternal God.

Creatures with all their endless race
Thy pow’r and praise proclaim;
But saints that taste Thy richer grace
Delight to bless Thy name.

# REST FOR THE WEARY

Come, Thou Fount of ev-’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mer-cy, nev-er ceas-ing,
Call for songs of loud-est praise.

[chorus]
There is rest for the wea-ry,
There is rest for you.

Here I’ll raise my Eb-en-ez-er,
Hith-er by Thy help I’m come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleas-ure,
Safe-ly to ar-rive at home.

Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

[chorus]
There is rest for the weary,
There is rest for you.

Here I’ll raise my Ebenezer,
Hither by Thy help I’m come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.

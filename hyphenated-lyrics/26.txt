# SAMARIA

My spir-it looks to God a-lone,
My rock and ref-uge is His throne;
In all my fears, in all my straits,
My soul on His sal-va-tion waits.
Trust Him, ye saints, in all your ways,
Pour out your hearts be-fore His face;
When hel-pers fail and foes in-vade,
God is our all-suf-fi-cient aid.

Make not in-creas-ing gold your trust,
Nor set your heart on glit-t’ring dust;
Why will you grasp the fleet-ing smoke,
And not be-lieve what God hath spoke?
For sov-’reign pow’r reigns not a-lone,
Grace is the part-ner of the throne;
Thy grace and jus-tice, might-y Lord,
Shall well di-vide our last re-ward.

My spirit looks to God alone,
My rock and refuge is His throne;
In all my fears, in all my straits,
My soul on His salvation waits.
Trust Him, ye saints, in all your ways,
Pour out your hearts before His face;
When helpers fail and foes invade,
God is our all-sufficient aid.

Make not increasing gold your trust,
Nor set your heart on glitt’ring dust;
Why will you grasp the fleeting smoke,
And not believe what God hath spoke?
For sov’reign pow’r reigns not alone,
Grace is the partner of the throne;
Thy grace and justice, mighty Lord,
Shall well divide our last reward.

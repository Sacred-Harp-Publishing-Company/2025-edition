# BRIDGEWATER

From all that dwell be-low the skies,
Let the Re-deem-er’s praise a-rise:
Let the Re-deem-er’s name be sung
Through ev-’ry land, by ev-’ry tongue.

------

From all that dwell below the skies,
Let the Redeemer’s praise arise:
Let the Redeemer’s name be sung
Through ev’ry land, by ev’ry tongue.

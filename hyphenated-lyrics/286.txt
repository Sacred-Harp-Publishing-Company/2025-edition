# HEAVENLY HOME

While trav-’ling through the world be-low,
Where sore af-flic-tions come,
My soul a-bounds with joy to know
That I will rest at home.

[chorus]
I’ll bid fare-well to all be-low,
And to my Sav-ior go.

My soul’s de-light has been to sing
Of glo-rious days to come,
When I shall, with my God and King,
For-ev-er rest at home.

------

While trav’ling through the world below,
Where sore afflictions come,
My soul abounds with joy to know
That I will rest at home.

[chorus]
I’ll bid farewell to all below,
And to my Savior go.

My soul’s delight has been to sing
Of glorious days to come,
When I shall, with my God and King,
Forever rest at home.

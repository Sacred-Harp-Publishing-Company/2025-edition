# BALM IN GILEAD

Long hast thou wept and sor-rowed,
Poor mourn-er, dry thy tears;
Be-hold, with light and com-fort
The God of love ap-pears.

[chorus]
There’s balm in Gil-ead
To cure a sin-sick soul;
There’s balm in Gil-ead
To make the wound-ed whole.

The storm may roar a-bout you,
Your heart may low be laid;
But God is ev-er near you,
And can you be dis-mayed?

The seed, be-fore it flour-ish,
Must low in dark-ness lie;
And love, to live for-ev-er,
Must for a sea-son die.

Long hast thou wept and sorrowed,
Poor mourner, dry thy tears;
Behold, with light and comfort
The God of love appears.

[chorus]
There’s balm in Gilead
To cure a sin-sick soul;
There’s balm in Gilead
To make the wounded whole.

The storm may roar about you,
Your heart may low be laid;
But God is ever near you,
And can you be dismayed?

The seed, before it flourish,
Must low in darkness lie;
And love, to live forever,
Must for a season die.

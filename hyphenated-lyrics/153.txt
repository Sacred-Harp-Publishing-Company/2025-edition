# RESURRECTED

My fa-ther’s gone to view that land,
To wear a star-ry crown.

[chorus]
A-way o-ver yon-der
To wear a star-ry crown.

My moth-er’s gone to view that land,
To wear a star-ry crown.

------

My father’s gone to view that land,
To wear a starry crown.

[chorus]
Away over yonder
To wear a starry crown.

My mother’s gone to view that land,
To wear a starry crown.

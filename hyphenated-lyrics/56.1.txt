May the grace of Christ our Sav-ior,
And the Fa-ther’s bound-less love,
With the Ho-ly Spi-rit’s fa-vor,
Rest up-on us from a-bove.

Thus may we a-bide in un-ion
With each oth-er and the Lord,
And pos-sess in sweet com-mun-ion
Joys which earth can-not af-ford.

May the grace of Christ our Savior,
And the Father’s boundless love,
With the Holy Spirit’s favor,
Rest upon us from above.

Thus may we abide in union
With each other and the Lord,
And possess in sweet communion
Joys which earth cannot afford.

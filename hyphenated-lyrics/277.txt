I know that my Re-deem-er lives,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
What com-fort this sweet sen-tence gives,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

[chorus]
Shout on, pray on, we’re gain-ing ground,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
The dead’s a-live and the lost is found,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

He lives to bless you with His love,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
He lives to plead my cause a-bove,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

He lives to crush the fiends of hell,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
He lives and doth with-in me dwell,
Glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

------

I know that my Redeemer lives,
Glory, hallelujah!
What comfort this sweet sentence gives,
Glory, hallelujah!

[chorus]
Shout on, pray on, we’re gaining ground,
Glory, hallelujah!
The dead’s alive and the lost is found,
Glory, hallelujah!

He lives to bless you with His love,
Glory, hallelujah!
He lives to plead my cause above,
Glory, hallelujah!

He lives to crush the fiends of hell,
Glory, hallelujah!
He lives and doth within me dwell,
Glory, hallelujah!

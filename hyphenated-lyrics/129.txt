# HEAVENLY ARMOR

And if you meet with trou-bles
And tri-als on the way,
Then cast your care on Je-sus,
And don’t for-get to pray.
Gird on the heav’n-ly ar-mor
Of faith and hope and love,
And when the com-bat’s end-ed,
He’ll take you up a-bove.

Through grace I am de-ter-mined
To con-quer, though I die,
And then a-way to Je-sus
On wings of love I’ll fly;
Fare-well to sin and sor-row,
I bid you all a-dieu!
Then, O my friends, prove faith-ful,
And on your way pur-sue.

------

And if you meet with troubles
And trials on the way,
Then cast your care on Jesus,
And don’t forget to pray.
Gird on the heav’nly armor
Of faith and hope and love,
And when the combat’s ended,
He’ll take you up above.

Through grace I am determined
To conquer, though I die,
And then away to Jesus
On wings of love I’ll fly;
Farewell to sin and sorrow,
I bid you all adieu!
Then, O my friends, prove faithful,
And on your way pursue.

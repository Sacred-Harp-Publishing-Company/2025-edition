# MORALITY

While beau-ty and youth are in their full prime,
And fol-ly and fash-ion af-fect our whole time,
Oh, let not the phan-tom our wish-es en-gage;
Let’s live so in youth that we blush not in age.

I sigh not for beau-ty, nor lan-guish for wealth,
But grant me, kind Prov-i-dence, vir-tue and health;
Then, rich-er than kings, and far hap-pier than they,
My days shall pass swift-ly and sweet-ly a-way.

The vain and the young may at-tend us a while,
But let not their flat-t’ry our pru-dence be-guile;
Let’s cov-et those charms that shall nev-er de-cay,
Nor lis-ten to all that de-ceiv-ers can say.

While beauty and youth are in their full prime,
And folly and fashion affect our whole time,
Oh, let not the phantom our wishes engage;
Let’s live so in youth that we blush not in age.

I sigh not for beauty, nor languish for wealth,
But grant me, kind Providence, virtue and health;
Then, richer than kings, and far happier than they,
My days shall pass swiftly and sweetly away.

The vain and the young may attend us a while,
But let not their flatt’ry our prudence beguile;
Let’s covet those charms that shall never decay,
Nor listen to all that deceivers can say.

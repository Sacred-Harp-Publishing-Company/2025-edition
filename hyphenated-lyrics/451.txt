O Thou whose mer-cy guides my way,
Though now it seems se-vere,
For-bid my un-be-lief to say,
There is no mer-cy here.
O may I, Lord, de-sire the pain
That comes in kind-ness down
Far more than sweet-est earth-ly gain
Suc-ceed-ed by a frown.

O Thou whose mercy guides my way,
Though now it seems severe,
Forbid my unbelief to say,
There is no mercy here.
O may I, Lord, desire the pain
That comes in kindness down
Far more than sweetest earthly gain
Succeeded by a frown.

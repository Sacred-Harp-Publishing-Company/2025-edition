# MOUNT ZION

The hill of Zi-on yields
A thou-sand sa-cred sweets,
Be-fore we reach the heav’n-ly fields,
Or walk the gold-en streets.
Then let your songs a-bound,
And ev-’ry tear be dry;
We’re march-ing through Im-man-uel’s ground
To fair-er worlds on high.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets.
Then let your songs abound,
And ev’ry tear be dry;
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground
To fairer worlds on high.

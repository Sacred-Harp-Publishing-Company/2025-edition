# MONTGOMERY

Ear-ly, my God, with-out de-lay,
I haste to seek Thy face;
My thirst-y spir-it faints a-way
With-out Thy cheer-ing grace;
So pil-grims on the scorch-ing sand,
Be-neath a burn-ing sky,
Long for a cool-ing stream at hand,
And they must drink or die.

Early, my God, without delay,
I haste to seek Thy face;
My thirsty spirit faints away
Without Thy cheering grace;
So pilgrims on the scorching sand,
Beneath a burning sky,
Long for a cooling stream at hand,
And they must drink or die.

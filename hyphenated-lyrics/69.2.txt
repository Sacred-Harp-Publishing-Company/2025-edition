# FAREWELL TO ALL

And now, my friends, both old and young,
I hope in Christ you will go on;
And if on earth we meet no more,
Oh, may we meet on Ca-naan’s shore.
I hope you’ll all re-mem-ber me
If you on earth no more I see;
An in-t’rest in your prayers I crave,
That we may meet be-yond the grave.

And now, my friends, both old and young,
I hope in Christ you will go on;
And if on earth we meet no more,
Oh, may we meet on Canaan’s shore.
I hope you’ll all remember me
If you on earth no more I see;
An int’rest in your prayers I crave,
That we may meet beyond the grave.

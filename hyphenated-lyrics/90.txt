# LOOK OUT

My breth-ren all, on you I call,
A-rise and look a-round you.
How man-y foes, bound to op-pose,
Who’re wait-ing to con-found you!
The gos-pel calls on Zi-on’s walls,
Shake off your sleep and slum-ber;
A-rise and pray, we’ll win the day,
Though we are few in num-ber.

My brethren all, on you I call,
Arise and look around you.
How many foes, bound to oppose,
Who’re waiting to confound you!
The gospel calls on Zion’s walls,
Shake off your sleep and slumber;
Arise and pray, we’ll win the day,
Though we are few in number.

# THE DYING BOY

I’m dy-ing, Moth-er, dy-ing now,
Please raise my ach-ing head,
And fan my heat-ed, burn-ing brow;
Your boy will soon be dead.
Turn o’er my pil-low once a-gain,
And kiss my fe-vered cheek;
I’ll soon be freed from all the pain,
For now I am so weak.

I’m dying, Mother, dying now,
Please raise my aching head,
And fan my heated, burning brow;
Your boy will soon be dead.
Turn o’er my pillow once again,
And kiss my fevered cheek;
I’ll soon be freed from all the pain,
For now I am so weak.

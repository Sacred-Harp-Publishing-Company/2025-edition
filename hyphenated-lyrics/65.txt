# SWEET PROSPECT

On Jor-dan’s storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a wish-ful eye
To Ca-naan’s fair and hap-py land
Where my pos-ses-sions lie.

[chorus]
Oh, the trans-port-ing, rap-t’rous scene
That ris-es to my sight!
Sweet fields ar-rayed in liv-ing green,
And riv-ers of de-light.

O’er all those wide, ex-tend-ed plains
Shines one e-ter-nal day;
There God the Son for-ev-er reigns
And scat-ters night a-way.

No chill-ing winds or pois-’nous breath
Can reach that health-ful shore;
Sick-ness and sor-row, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more.

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.

[chorus]
Oh, the transporting, rapt’rous scene
That rises to my sight!
Sweet fields arrayed in living green,
And rivers of delight.

O’er all those wide, extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds or pois’nous breath
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more.

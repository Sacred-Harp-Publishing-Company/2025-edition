# FEW HAPPY MATCHES

When Thou, my right-eous Judge, shalt come
To take Thy ran-somed peo-ple home,
Shall I a-mong them stand?
Shall such a worth-less worm as I,
Who some-times am a-fraid to die,
Be found at Thy right hand?

I love to meet Thy peo-ple now,
Be-fore Thy feet with them to bow,
Though vil-est of them all;
But can I bear the pierc-ing thought:
What if my name should be left out
When Thou for them shalt call?

O Lord, pre-vent it by Thy grace,
Be Thou my on-ly hid-ing place,
In this ac-cept-ed day;
Thy par-d’ning voice, oh, let me hear
To still my un-be-liev-ing fear,
Nor let me fall, I pray.

When Thou, my righteous Judge, shalt come
To take Thy ransomed people home,
Shall I among them stand?
Shall such a worthless worm as I,
Who sometimes am afraid to die,
Be found at Thy right hand?

I love to meet Thy people now,
Before Thy feet with them to bow,
Though vilest of them all;
But can I bear the piercing thought:
What if my name should be left out
When Thou for them shalt call?

O Lord, prevent it by Thy grace,
Be Thou my only hiding place,
In this accepted day;
Thy pard’ning voice, oh, let me hear
To still my unbelieving fear,
Nor let me fall, I pray.

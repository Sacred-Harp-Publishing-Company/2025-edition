# DEVOTION

Sweet is the day of sa-cred rest,
No mor-tal cares shall seize my breast;
O may my heart in tune be found,
Like Da-vid’s harp of sol-emn sound.

Then shall I share a glo-rious part,
When grace hath well re-fined my heart,
And fresh sup-plies of joy are shed,
Like ho-ly oil, to cheer my head.

Then shall I see and hear and know
All I de-sired and wished be-low,
And ev-’ry pow’r find sweet em-ploy
In that e-ter-nal world of joy.

Sweet is the day of sacred rest,
No mortal cares shall seize my breast;
O may my heart in tune be found,
Like David’s harp of solemn sound.

Then shall I share a glorious part,
When grace hath well refined my heart,
And fresh supplies of joy are shed,
Like holy oil, to cheer my head.

Then shall I see and hear and know
All I desired and wished below,
And ev’ry pow’r find sweet employ
In that eternal world of joy.

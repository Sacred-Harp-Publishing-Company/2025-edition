# YOUTH WILL SOON BE GONE

Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By fleet-ing time or con-qu’ring death;
Your morn-ing sun may set at noon,
And leave you ev-er in the dark.
Your spar-kling eyes and glow-ing cheeks
Must with-er like the blast-ed rose;
The cof-fin, earth, and wind-ing sheet
Will soon your ac-tive limbs en-close.

Ye heed-less ones that wild-ly stroll,
The grave will soon be-come your bed,
Where si-lence reigns and va-pors roll
In sol-emn dark-ness round your head.
Your friends will pass the lone-some place
And with a sigh move slow-ly on,
Still gaz-ing on the spires of grass
With which your graves are o-ver-grown.

Ye bloom-ing youth, this is the state
Of all who do free grace re-fuse;
And soon with you ’twill be too late
The way of life and Christ to choose.
Come lay your car-nal weap-ons by,
No long-er fight a-gainst your God:
But with the gos-pel now com-ply,
And heav’n shall be your great re-ward.

Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By fleeting time or conqu’ring death;
Your morning sun may set at noon,
And leave you ever in the dark.
Your sparkling eyes and glowing cheeks
Must wither like the blasted rose;
The coffin, earth, and winding sheet
Will soon your active limbs enclose.

Ye heedless ones that wildly stroll,
The grave will soon become your bed,
Where silence reigns and vapors roll
In solemn darkness round your head.
Your friends will pass the lonesome place
And with a sigh move slowly on,
Still gazing on the spires of grass
With which your graves are overgrown.

Ye blooming youth, this is the state
Of all who do free grace refuse;
And soon with you ’twill be too late
The way of life and Christ to choose.
Come lay your carnal weapons by,
No longer fight against your God:
But with the gospel now comply,
And heav’n shall be your great reward.

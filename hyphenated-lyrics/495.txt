# THE MIDNIGHT CRY

When the mid-night cry be-gan,
O what lam-en-ta-tion,
Thou-sands sleep-ing in their sins,
Neglect-ing their sal-va-tion.
Lo, the Bride-groom is at hand,
Who will kind-ly treat Him?
Sure-ly all the wait-ing band
Will now go forth to meet Him.

Some, in-deed, did wait a-while,
Shone with-out a ri-val,
But they spent their seem-ing oil,
Long since last re-viv-al.
Man-y souls who thought they’d light,
Oh, when scene was clos-ed,
Now a-gainst the Bride-groom fight,
And so they stand op-pos-ed.

When the midnight cry began,
O what lamentation,
Thousands sleeping in their sins,
Neglecting their salvation.
Lo, the Bridegroom is at hand,
Who will kindly treat Him?
Surely all the waiting band
Will now go forth to meet Him.

Some, indeed, did wait awhile,
Shone without a rival,
But they spent their seeming oil,
Long since last revival.
Many souls who thought they’d light,
Oh, when scene was closed,
Now against the Bridegroom fight,
And so they stand opposed.

Great God, let all my tune-ful pow’rs
A-wake and sing Thy praise.
I’ll sing God’s praise through end-less days,
And live for-ev-er-more.

[chorus]
Be-hold the love the Sav-ior showed
When He died up-on the cross for sin-ners.
And who-so-ev-er will be-lieve on Je-sus’ word
Shall live and sing His praise a-bove,
Through end-less days to come,
In heav’n a-bove, where all is love,
To live for-ev-er-more.

Great God, let all my tuneful pow’rs
Awake and sing Thy praise.
I’ll sing God’s praise through endless days,
And live forevermore.

[chorus]
Behold the love the Savior showed
When He died upon the cross for sinners.
And whosoever will believe on Jesus’ word
Shall live and sing His praise above,
Through endless days to come,
In heav’n above, where all is love,
To live forevermore.

# ODE OF LIFE’S JOURNEY

I be-gan life’s jour-ney when young,
And the glit-t’ring pros-pect charmed my eyes;
I saw joy af-ter joy suc-ces-sive rise
A-long the ex-tend-ed plain.
But soon I found ’twas all a dream,
And learned the fond pur-suit to shun,
Where few can reach the pur-posed aim,
And thou-sands dai-ly are un-done.

I began life’s journey when young,
And the glitt’ring prospect charmed my eyes;
I saw joy after joy successive rise
Along the extended plain.
But soon I found ’twas all a dream,
And learned the fond pursuit to shun,
Where few can reach the purposed aim,
And thousands daily are undone.

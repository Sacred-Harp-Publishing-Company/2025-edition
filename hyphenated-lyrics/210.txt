See the Lord of glo-ry dy-ing!
See Him gasp-ing! hear Him cry-ing!
See His bur-dened bos-om heave!
Look, ye sin-ners, ye that hung Him,
Look how deep your sins have stung Him!
Dy-ing sin-ners, look and live.

Bear with pa-tience trib-u-la-tion,
O-ver-com-ing all temp-ta-tion,
Till the glo-rious ju-bi-lee;
Soon He’ll come with bursts of thun-der,
Then we shall a-dore and won-der,
Sing-ing on the high-est key.

See the bliss-ful scenes be-fore us,
Join the u-ni-ver-sal cho-rus,
Bid the flow-ing num-bers rise;
Songs im-mor-tal sweet-ly sound-ing,
Notes an-gel-ic loud re-bound-ing,
Trem-bling round the vo-cal skies.

See the Lord of glory dying!
See Him gasping! hear Him crying!
See His burdened bosom heave!
Look, ye sinners, ye that hung Him,
Look how deep your sins have stung Him!
Dying sinners, look and live.

Bear with patience tribulation,
Overcoming all temptation,
Till the glorious jubilee;
Soon He’ll come with bursts of thunder,
Then we shall adore and wonder,
Singing on the highest key.

See the blissful scenes before us,
Join the universal chorus,
Bid the flowing numbers rise;
Songs immortal sweetly sounding,
Notes angelic loud rebounding,
Trembling round the vocal skies.

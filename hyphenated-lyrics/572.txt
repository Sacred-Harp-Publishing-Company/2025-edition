# THE LAMB OF GOD

In those days came John the Bap-tist, preach-ing in the wil-der-ness, cry-ing with a loud voice, say-ing,
“Be-hold, the Lamb of God, which tak-eth a-way the sin of the world,
Which tak-eth a-way the sin of the world.”

In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness, crying with a loud voice, saying,
“Behold, the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world,
Which taketh away the sin of the world.”

# GREEN FIELDS

How te-dious and taste-less the hours
When Je-sus no long-er I see!
Sweet pros-pects, sweet birds, and sweet flow’rs
Have lost all their sweet-ness to me.
The mid-sum-mer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay,
But when I am hap-py in Him,
De-cem-ber’s as pleas-ant as May.

His name yields the sweet-est per-fume,
And sweet-er than mu-sic His voice;
His pres-ence dis-pers-es my gloom,
And makes all with-in me re-joice.
I should, were He al-ways thus nigh,
Have noth-ing to wish or to fear;
No mor-tal as hap-py as I,
My sum-mer would last all the year.

Con-tent with be-hold-ing His face,
My all to His pleas-ures re-signed,
No chang-es of sea-son or place
Would make an-y change in my mind.
While blest with a sense of His love,
A pal-ace a toy would ap-pear,
And pris-ons would pal-ac-es prove,
If Je-sus would dwell with me there.

Dear Lord, if in-deed I am Thine,
If Thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I lan-guish and pine,
And why are my win-ters so long?
Oh, drive these dark clouds from my sky,
Thy soul-cheer-ing pres-ence re-store,
Or take me to Thee up on high,
Where win-ter and clouds are no more.

How tedious and tasteless the hours
When Jesus no longer I see!
Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flow’rs
Have lost all their sweetness to me.
The midsummer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay,
But when I am happy in Him,
December’s as pleasant as May.

His name yields the sweetest perfume,
And sweeter than music His voice;
His presence disperses my gloom,
And makes all within me rejoice.
I should, were He always thus nigh,
Have nothing to wish or to fear;
No mortal as happy as I,
My summer would last all the year.

Content with beholding His face,
My all to His pleasures resigned,
No changes of season or place
Would make any change in my mind.
While blest with a sense of His love,
A palace a toy would appear,
And prisons would palaces prove,
If Jesus would dwell with me there.

Dear Lord, if indeed I am Thine,
If Thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I languish and pine,
And why are my winters so long?
Oh, drive these dark clouds from my sky,
Thy soul-cheering presence restore,
Or take me to Thee up on high,
Where winter and clouds are no more.

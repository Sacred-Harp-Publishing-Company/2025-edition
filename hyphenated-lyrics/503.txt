My Sav-ior and my King,
Thy beau-ties are di-vine;
Thy lips with bless-ing o-ver-flow,
And ev-’ry grace is Thine.

The smil-ings of Thy face,
How a-mia-ble they are!
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine em-brace,
And no-where else but there.

Nor earth nor all the sky
Can one de-light af-ford—
No, not a drop of Thy real joy,
With-out Thy pres-ence, Lord.

My Savior and my King,
Thy beauties are divine;
Thy lips with blessing overflow,
And ev’ry grace is Thine.

The smilings of Thy face,
How amiable they are!
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine embrace,
And nowhere else but there.

Nor earth nor all the sky
Can one delight afford—
No, not a drop of Thy real joy,
Without Thy presence, Lord.

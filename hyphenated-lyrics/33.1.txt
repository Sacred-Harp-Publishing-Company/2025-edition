# WEEPING SAVIOR

Did Christ o’er sin-ners weep?
And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of pen-i-ten-tial grief
Burst forth from ev-’ry eye.

The Son of God in tears
The won-d’ring an-gels see;
Be thou as-ton-ished, O my soul;
He shed those tears for thee.

He wept that we might weep;
Each sin de-mands a tear;
In heav’n a-lone no sin is found,
And there’s no weep-ing there.

Did Christ o’er sinners weep?
And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of penitential grief
Burst forth from ev’ry eye.

The Son of God in tears
The wond’ring angels see;
Be thou astonished, O my soul;
He shed those tears for thee.

He wept that we might weep;
Each sin demands a tear;
In heav’n alone no sin is found,
And there’s no weeping there.

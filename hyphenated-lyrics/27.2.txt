# ROCHESTER

Come, let us join our cheer-ful songs
With an-gels round the throne;
Ten thou-sand thou-sand are their tongues,
But all their joys are one.

Let all that dwell a-bove the sky,
And air, and earth, and seas,
Con-spire to lift Thy glo-ries high,
And speak Thine end-less praise.

The whole cre-a-tion joins in one,
To bless the sa-cred name
Of Him that sits up-on the throne,
And to a-dore the Lamb.

------

Come, let us join our cheerful songs
With angels round the throne;
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
But all their joys are one.

Let all that dwell above the sky,
And air, and earth, and seas,
Conspire to lift Thy glories high,
And speak Thine endless praise.

The whole creation joins in one,
To bless the sacred name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
And to adore the Lamb.

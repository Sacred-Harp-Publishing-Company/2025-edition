# CHRISTIAN’S FAREWELL

Breth-ren, fare-well, I do you tell,
I’m sor-ry to leave, I love you so well.
Now I must go, where I don’t know,
Wher-ev-er Christ leads me
The trum-pet to blow.

Here I have worked, la-bored a-while,
But la-bor is sweet if Je-sus doth smile.
When I am done, I will go home
Where Je-sus is smil-ing
And bids me to come.

Brethren, farewell, I do you tell,
I’m sorry to leave, I love you so well.
Now I must go, where I don’t know,
Wherever Christ leads me
The trumpet to blow.

Here I have worked, labored awhile,
But labor is sweet if Jesus doth smile.
When I am done, I will go home
Where Jesus is smiling
And bids me to come.

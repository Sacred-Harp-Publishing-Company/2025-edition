# THE ROCK THAT IS HIGHER THAN I

Con-vinced as a sin-ner, to Je-sus I come,
In-formed by the gos-pel for such there is room;
O’er-whelm-ed with sor-rows for sin I will cry,
Lead me to the rock that is high-er than I,

[chorus]
High-er than I, high-er than I,
Lead me to the rock that is high-er than I.

When sore-ly af-flict-ed and read-y to faint,
Be-fore my Re-deem-er I’ll spread my com-plaint;
Mid storms and dis-tress-es my soul shall re-ly
On Je-sus, the rock that is high-er than I,

’Tis there with the cho-sen of Je-sus, I long
To dwell and e-ter-nal-ly join in the song,
And prais-ing and bless-ings, with an-gels on high,
It’s Je-sus, the rock that is high-er than I,

------

Convinced as a sinner, to Jesus I come,
Informed by the gospel for such there is room;
O’erwhelmed with sorrows for sin I will cry,
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I,

[chorus]
Higher than I, higher than I,
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

When sorely afflicted and ready to faint,
Before my Redeemer I’ll spread my complaint;
Mid storms and distresses my soul shall rely
On Jesus, the rock that is higher than I,

’Tis there with the chosen of Jesus, I long
To dwell and eternally join in the song,
And praising and blessings, with angels on high,
It’s Jesus, the rock that is higher than I,

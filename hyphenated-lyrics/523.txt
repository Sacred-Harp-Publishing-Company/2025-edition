# JUST FOR A DAY

Just for a day, dear Lord, with Thee,
My soul from earth-ly care set free:
No oth-er hand to guide my way,
No oth-er voice to an-swer nay.

There’s naught in life so great as this;
No oth-er one can give such bliss;
’Tis on-ly through our Lord’s com-mand
That we in mer-cy there may stand.

On-ly a day, dear Lord with Thee,
And I, Thy ser-vant, glad to be;
On-ly Thy face just let me see,
And in death’s hour re-mem-ber me.

Just for a day, dear Lord, with Thee,
My soul from earthly care set free:
No other hand to guide my way,
No other voice to answer nay.

There’s naught in life so great as this;
No other one can give such bliss;
’Tis only through our Lord’s command
That we in mercy there may stand.

Only a day, dear Lord with Thee,
And I, Thy servant, glad to be;
Only Thy face just let me see,
And in death’s hour remember me.

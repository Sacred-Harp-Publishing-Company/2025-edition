# SAVE, MIGHTY LORD

Je-sus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
Save, might-y Lord,
He whom I fix my hopes up-on,
Save, might-y Lord.

[chorus]
O, save, save, might-y Lord,
And send con-vert-ing pow-er down,
Save, might-y Lord.

The way the ho-ly proph-et went,
Save, might-y Lord,
The road that leads from ban-ish-ment,
Save, might-y Lord.

The King’s high-way of ho-li-ness,
Save, might-y Lord,
I’ll go, for all His paths are peace,
Save, might-y Lord.

Jesus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
Save, mighty Lord,
He whom I fix my hopes upon,
Save, mighty Lord.

[chorus]
O, save, save, mighty Lord,
And send converting power down,
Save, mighty Lord.

The way the holy prophet went,
Save, mighty Lord,
The road that leads from banishment,
Save, mighty Lord.

The King’s highway of holiness,
Save, mighty Lord,
I’ll go, for all His paths are peace,
Save, mighty Lord.

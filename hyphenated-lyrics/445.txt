# PASSING AWAY

And must I be to judg-ment brought
And an-swer in that day
For ev-’ry vain and i-dle thought
And ev-’ry word I say?

[chorus]
We are pass-ing a-way
To that great judg-ment day.

Yes, ev-’ry se-cret of my heart
Shall short-ly be made known
And I re-ceive my just des-ert
For all that I have done.

How care-ful, then, ought I to be,
With what re-li-gious fear,
Who such a strict ac-count must give
For my be-hav-ior here.

------

And must I be to judgment brought
And answer in that day
For ev’ry vain and idle thought
And ev’ry word I say?

[chorus]
We are passing away
To that great judgment day.

Yes, ev’ry secret of my heart
Shall shortly be made known
And I receive my just desert
For all that I have done.

How careful, then, ought I to be,
With what religious fear,
Who such a strict account must give
For my behavior here.

# THE LAST WORDS OF COPERNICUS

Ye gold-en lamps of heav’n, fare-well,
With all your fee-ble light;
Fare-well, thou ev-er-chang-ing moon,
Pale em-press of the night.
And thou re-ful-gent orb of day,
In bright-er flames ar-rayed:
My soul, which springs be-yond thy sphere,
No more de-mands thy aid.

------

Ye golden lamps of heav’n, farewell,
With all your feeble light;
Farewell, thou ever-changing moon,
Pale empress of the night.
And thou refulgent orb of day,
In brighter flames arrayed:
My soul, which springs beyond thy sphere,
No more demands thy aid.

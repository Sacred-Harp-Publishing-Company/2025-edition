Be-hold the love, the gen-’rous love,
That ho-ly Da-vid shows;
Be-hold his kind com-pas-sion move
For his af-flict-ed foes!
When they are sick, his soul com-plains
And seems to feel the smart;
The spir-it of the gos-pel reigns,
And melts his pi-ous heart.

Behold the love, the gen’rous love,
That holy David shows;
Behold his kind compassion move
For his afflicted foes!
When they are sick, his soul complains
And seems to feel the smart;
The spirit of the gospel reigns,
And melts his pious heart.

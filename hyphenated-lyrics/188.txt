# EPHESUS

Great God, the heav’ns’ well-or-dered frame
De-clares the glo-ries of Thy name;
There Thy rich works of won-der shine:
A thou-sand star-ry beau-ties there,
A thou-sand ra-diant marks ap-pear
Of bound-less pow’r and skill di-vine.

Great God, the heav’ns’ well-ordered frame
Declares the glories of Thy name;
There Thy rich works of wonder shine:
A thousand starry beauties there,
A thousand radiant marks appear
Of boundless pow’r and skill divine.

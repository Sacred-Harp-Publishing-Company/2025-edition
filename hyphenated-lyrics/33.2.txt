# ABBEVILLE

Come, Ho-ly Spir-it, come,
With en-er-gy di-vine,
And on this poor, be-night-ed soul
With beams of mer-cy shine.

Melt, melt this fro-zen heart;
This stub-born will sub-due;
Each e-vil pas-sion o-ver-come,
And form me all a-new.

Mine will the prof-it be,
But Thine shall be the praise;
And un-to Thee will I de-vote
The rem-nant of my days.

Come, Holy Spirit, come,
With energy divine,
And on this poor, benighted soul
With beams of mercy shine.

Melt, melt this frozen heart;
This stubborn will subdue;
Each evil passion overcome,
And form me all anew.

Mine will the profit be,
But Thine shall be the praise;
And unto Thee will I devote
The remnant of my days.

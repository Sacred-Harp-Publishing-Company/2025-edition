# THE WEARY SOUL

Ye wea-ry, heav-y-lad-en souls,
Who are op-pressed and sore,
Ye trav-’lers through the wil-der-ness
To Ca-naan’s peace-ful shore,
Through chill-ing winds and beat-ing rains,
And wa-ters deep and cold,
And en-e-mies sur-round-ing us,
Take cour-age and be bold.

Fare-well, my breth-ren in the Lord,
Who are for Ca-naan bound,
And should we nev-er meet a-gain
Till Ga-briel’s trump shall sound,
I hope that I shall meet you there
On that de-light-ful shore,
In man-sions of e-ter-nal bliss,
Where part-ing is no more.

Ye weary, heavy-laden souls,
Who are oppressed and sore,
Ye trav’lers through the wilderness
To Canaan’s peaceful shore,
Through chilling winds and beating rains,
And waters deep and cold,
And enemies surrounding us,
Take courage and be bold.

Farewell, my brethren in the Lord,
Who are for Canaan bound,
And should we never meet again
Till Gabriel’s trump shall sound,
I hope that I shall meet you there
On that delightful shore,
In mansions of eternal bliss,
Where parting is no more.

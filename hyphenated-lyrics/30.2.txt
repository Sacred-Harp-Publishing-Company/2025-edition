# PROSPECT

Why should we start and fear to die?
What tim-’rous worms we mor-tals are!
Death is the gate to end-less joy,
And yet we dread to en-ter there.

The pains, the groans, the dy-ing strife
Fright our ap-proach-ing souls a-way;
And we shrink back a-gain to life,
Fond of our pris-on and our clay.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fear-less through death’s i-ron gate,
Nor feel the ter-rors as she passed.

Je-sus can make a dy-ing bed
Feel soft as down-y pil-lows are,
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out sweet-ly there.

Why should we start and fear to die?
What tim’rous worms we mortals are!
Death is the gate to endless joy,
And yet we dread to enter there.

The pains, the groans, the dying strife
Fright our approaching souls away;
And we shrink back again to life,
Fond of our prison and our clay.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fearless through death’s iron gate,
Nor feel the terrors as she passed.

Jesus can make a dying bed
Feel soft as downy pillows are,
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out sweetly there.

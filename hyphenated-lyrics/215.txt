# NEW TOPIA

Young peo-ple all, at-ten-tion give
And hear what I do say;
I want your souls with Christ to live
In ev-er-last-ing day.
Re-mem-ber you are hast-’ning on
To death’s dark, gloom-y shade;
Your joys on earth will soon be gone,
Your flesh in dust be laid.

Young people all, attention give
And hear what I do say;
I want your souls with Christ to live
In everlasting day.
Remember you are hast’ning on
To death’s dark, gloomy shade;
Your joys on earth will soon be gone,
Your flesh in dust be laid.

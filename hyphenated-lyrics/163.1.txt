# MORNING

He dies, the friend of sin-ners dies;
Lo, Sa-lem’s daugh-ters weep a-round;
A sol-emn dark-ness veils the skies,
A sud-den trem-bling shakes the ground.

Ye saints ap-proach! the an-guish view
Of Him who groans be-neath your load;
He gives His pre-cious life for you,
For you He sheds His pre-cious blood.

Here’s love and grief be-yond de-gree:
The Lord of glo-ry dies for men!
But lo, what sud-den joys we see!
Je-sus the dead re-vives a-gain.

The ris-ing God for-sakes the tomb,
Up to His Fa-ther’s court He flies;
Che-ru-bic le-gions guard Him home
And shout Him wel-come to the skies.

He dies, the friend of sinners dies;
Lo, Salem’s daughters weep around;
A solemn darkness veils the skies,
A sudden trembling shakes the ground.

Ye saints approach! the anguish view
Of Him who groans beneath your load;
He gives His precious life for you,
For you He sheds His precious blood.

Here’s love and grief beyond degree:
The Lord of glory dies for men!
But lo, what sudden joys we see!
Jesus the dead revives again.

The rising God forsakes the tomb,
Up to His Father’s court He flies;
Cherubic legions guard Him home
And shout Him welcome to the skies.

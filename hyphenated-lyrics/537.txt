# PORTSMOUTH

Come, sin-ners, to the gos-pel feast;
Let ev-’ry soul be Je-sus’ guest;
Ye need not one be left be-hind,
For God hath bid-den all man-kind.

Come, all ye souls by sin op-pressed,
Ye rest-less wan-d’rers af-ter rest!
Yield to His love’s re-sist-less pow’r,
And fight a-gainst your God no more.

This is the time, no more de-lay;
This is the glo-rious gos-pel day:
Come in this mo-ment at His call,
And live for Him who died for all.

Come, sinners, to the gospel feast;
Let ev’ry soul be Jesus’ guest;
Ye need not one be left behind,
For God hath bidden all mankind.

Come, all ye souls by sin oppressed,
Ye restless wand’rers after rest!
Yield to His love’s resistless pow’r,
And fight against your God no more.

This is the time, no more delay;
This is the glorious gospel day:
Come in this moment at His call,
And live for Him who died for all.

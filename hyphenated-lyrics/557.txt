# NEW FAREWELL

Fare-well, my lov-ing friends, fare-well!
We must be sep-a-rat-ed,
In dif-f’rent re-gions we must dwell,
Dis-tant-ly sit-u-at-ed.
O let not this our friend-ship chill,
Though moun-tains rise be-tween us;
May truth and jus-tice guide our will,
And God from e-vil screen us.

------

Farewell, my loving friends, farewell!
We must be separated,
In diff’rent regions we must dwell,
Distantly situated.
O let not this our friendship chill,
Though mountains rise between us;
May truth and justice guide our will,
And God from evil screen us.

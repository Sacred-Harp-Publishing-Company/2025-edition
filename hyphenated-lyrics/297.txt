# CONVERSION

When God re-vealed His gra-cious name
And changed my mourn-ful state,
My rap-ture seemed a pleas-ing dream,
The grace ap-peared so great.

The world be-held the glo-rious change
And did Thy hand con-fess;
My tongue broke out in un-known strains,
And sung sur-pris-ing grace.

When God revealed His gracious name
And changed my mournful state,
My rapture seemed a pleasing dream,
The grace appeared so great.

The world beheld the glorious change
And did Thy hand confess;
My tongue broke out in unknown strains,
And sung surprising grace.

# ALL SAINTS NEW

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fear-less through death’s i-ron gate,
Nor feel the ter-rors as she passed.
Je-sus can make a dy-ing bed
Feel soft as down-y pil-lows are,
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out sweet-ly there.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fearless through death’s iron gate,
Nor feel the terrors as she passed.
Jesus can make a dying bed
Feel soft as downy pillows are,
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out sweetly there.

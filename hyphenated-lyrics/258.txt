# INSPIRATION

Come, heav’n-ly love, in-spire my song
With Thy im-mor-tal flame,
And teach my heart, and teach my tongue,
The Sav-ior’s love-ly name.

Oh, the rich depths of love di-vine!
Of bliss, a bound-less store:
Dear Sav-ior, let me call Thee mine;
I can-not wish for more.

Come, heav’nly love, inspire my song
With Thy immortal flame,
And teach my heart, and teach my tongue,
The Savior’s lovely name.

Oh, the rich depths of love divine!
Of bliss, a boundless store:
Dear Savior, let me call Thee mine;
I cannot wish for more.

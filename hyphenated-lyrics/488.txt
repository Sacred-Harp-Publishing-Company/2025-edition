# RADIANCE

Thou love-ly source of true de-light,
Whom I un-seen a-dore!
Un-veil Thy beau-ties to my sight,
That I may love Thee more.
Thy glo-ry o’er cre-a-tion shines,
But in Thy sa-cred Word
I read in fair-er, bright-er lines
My bleed-ing, dy-ing Lord.

Je-sus! my Lord, my life, my light,
O come with bliss-ful ray;
Break ra-diant through the shades of night,
And chase my fears a-way.
Then shall my soul with rap-ture trace
The won-ders of Thy love;
But the full glo-ries of Thy face
Are on-ly known a-bove.

Thou lovely source of true delight,
Whom I unseen adore!
Unveil Thy beauties to my sight,
That I may love Thee more.
Thy glory o’er creation shines,
But in Thy sacred Word
I read in fairer, brighter lines
My bleeding, dying Lord.

Jesus! my Lord, my life, my light,
O come with blissful ray;
Break radiant through the shades of night,
And chase my fears away.
Then shall my soul with rapture trace
The wonders of Thy love;
But the full glories of Thy face
Are only known above.

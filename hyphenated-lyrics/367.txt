# NASSAU

Ye wea-ry, heav-y-lad-en souls,
Who are op-pressed and sore,
Ye trav-’lers through the wil-der-ness
To Ca-naan’s peace-ful shore,
Through chill-ing winds and beat-ing rains
And wa-ters deep and cold,
And en-e-mies sur-round-ing us,
Take cour-age and be bold.

------

Ye weary, heavy-laden souls,
Who are oppressed and sore,
Ye trav’lers through the wilderness
To Canaan’s peaceful shore,
Through chilling winds and beating rains
And waters deep and cold,
And enemies surrounding us,
Take courage and be bold.

# ETERNAL DAY

O what of all my suf-f’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that en-rap-tured host t’ap-pear,
And wor-ship at Thy feet!
Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends a-way,
But let me find them all a-gain
In that e-ter-nal day.

O what hath Je-sus bought for me,
Be-fore my rav-ished eyes?
Riv-ers of life di-vine I see,
And trees of par-a-dise.
I see a world of spir-its bright,
Who taste the pleas-ures there;
They all are robed in spot-less white,
And con-qu’ring palms they bear.

O what of all my suff’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that enraptured host t’appear,
And worship at Thy feet!
Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends away,
But let me find them all again
In that eternal day.

O what hath Jesus bought for me,
Before my ravished eyes?
Rivers of life divine I see,
And trees of paradise.
I see a world of spirits bright,
Who taste the pleasures there;
They all are robed in spotless white,
And conqu’ring palms they bear.

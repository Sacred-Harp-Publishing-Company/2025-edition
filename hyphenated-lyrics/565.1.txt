# HEBRON

Thus far the Lord hath led me on,
Thus far His pow’r pro-longed my days;
And ev-’ry eve-ning shall make known
Some fresh me-mo-rials of His grace.

Much of my time has run to waste,
And I, per-haps, am near my home;
But He for-gives my fol-lies past,
And gives me strength for days to come.

I lay my bod-y down to sleep;
Peace is the pil-low for my head,
While well-ap-point-ed an-gels keep
Their watch-ful sta-tions round my bed.

Thus far the Lord hath led me on,
Thus far His pow’r prolonged my days;
And ev’ry evening shall make known
Some fresh memorials of His grace.

Much of my time has run to waste,
And I, perhaps, am near my home;
But He forgives my follies past,
And gives me strength for days to come.

I lay my body down to sleep;
Peace is the pillow for my head,
While well-appointed angels keep
Their watchful stations round my bed.

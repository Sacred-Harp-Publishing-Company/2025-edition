# COMPLAINER

I am a great com-plain-er that bears the name of Christ;
Come, all ye Zi-on mourn-ers, and lis-ten to my cries;
I’ve man-y sore temp-ta-tions and sor-rows to my soul;
I feel my faith de-clin-ing, and my af-fec-tions cold.

I wish it was with me now as in the days of old,
The glo-rious light of Je-sus was flow-ing in my soul,
But now I am dis-tress-ed, and no re-lief can find,
A hard, de-ceit-ful heart and a wretch-ed, wan-d’ring mind.

It is great pride and pas-sion be-set me on my way,
So I am filled with fol-ly and so ne-glect to pray;
I am so weak I stum-ble, and so I’m left be-hind,
While oth-ers run re-joic-ing and seem to lose no time.

I am a great complainer that bears the name of Christ;
Come, all ye Zion mourners, and listen to my cries;
I’ve many sore temptations and sorrows to my soul;
I feel my faith declining, and my affections cold.

I wish it was with me now as in the days of old,
The glorious light of Jesus was flowing in my soul,
But now I am distressed, and no relief can find,
A hard, deceitful heart and a wretched, wand’ring mind.

It is great pride and passion beset me on my way,
So I am filled with folly and so neglect to pray;
I am so weak I stumble, and so I’m left behind,
While others run rejoicing and seem to lose no time.

# THE AMERICAN STAR

The spir-its of Wash-ing-ton, War-ren, Mont-go-mery
Look down from the clouds with bright as-pect se-rene.
Come, sol-diers, a tear and a toast to their mem-’ry,
Re-joic-ing they’ll see us as they once have been.
To us the high boon by the gods has been grant-ed
To spread the glad tid-ings of lib-er-ty far.
Let mil-lions in-vade us, we’ll meet them un-daunt-ed,
And con-quer or die by th’A-mer-i-can Star.

The spirits of Washington, Warren, Montgomery
Look down from the clouds with bright aspect serene.
Come, soldiers, a tear and a toast to their mem’ry,
Rejoicing they’ll see us as they once have been.
To us the high boon by the gods has been granted
To spread the glad tidings of liberty far.
Let millions invade us, we’ll meet them undaunted,
And conquer or die by th’American Star.

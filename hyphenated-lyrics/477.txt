# LORD, WE ADORE THEE

Ho-ly Lord, we wor-ship Thee,
Thine are we e-ter-nal-ly;
Yield-ed in Thy pres-ence bow,
Let us share Thy fa-vor now.

[chorus]
Ho-ly Lord, ho-ly Lord,
We have met in sweet ac-cord;
As we bow be-fore Thy shrine,
Make us, Sav-ior, whol-ly Thine.

God of glo-ry, pow’r, and grace,
Dy-ing for the hu-man race,
May we heed Thy ser-vice call,
Till the eve-ning shad-ows fall.

Holy Lord, we worship Thee,
Thine are we eternally;
Yielded in Thy presence bow,
Let us share Thy favor now.

[chorus]
Holy Lord, holy Lord,
We have met in sweet accord;
As we bow before Thy shrine,
Make us, Savior, wholly Thine.

God of glory, pow’r, and grace,
Dying for the human race,
May we heed Thy service call,
Till the evening shadows fall.

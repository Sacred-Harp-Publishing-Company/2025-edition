# VILLULIA

“Mer-cy, O Thou Son of Da-vid!”
Thus poor blind Bar-ti-meus prayed;
“Oth-ers by Thy grace are sav-ed,
Now to me af-ford Thine aid.”

Mon-ey was not what he want-ed,
Though by beg-ging used to live;
But he asked, and Je-sus grant-ed,
Alms which none but He could give.

“Lord, re-move this griev-ous blind-ness,
Let mine eyes be-hold the day!”
Straight he saw, and, won by kind-ness,
Fol-lowed Je-sus in the way.

“Mercy, O Thou Son of David!”
Thus poor blind Bartimeus prayed;
“Others by Thy grace are saved,
Now to me afford Thine aid.”

Money was not what he wanted,
Though by begging used to live;
But he asked, and Jesus granted,
Alms which none but He could give.

“Lord, remove this grievous blindness,
Let mine eyes behold the day!”
Straight he saw, and, won by kindness,
Followed Jesus in the way.

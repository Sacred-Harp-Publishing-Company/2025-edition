# LABAN

My soul, be on thy guard;
Ten thou-sand foes a-rise;
The hosts of sin are press-ing hard
To draw thee from the skies.

O watch, and fight, and pray;
The bat-tle ne’er give o’er;
Re-new the con-flict ev-’ry day,
And help di-vine im-plore.

Ne’er think the vic-t’ry won,
Nor lay thine ar-mor down;
The work of faith will not be done
Till thou ob-tain the crown.

Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God;
He’ll take thee at thy part-ing breath
To His di-vine a-bode.

My soul, be on thy guard;
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.

O watch, and fight, and pray;
The battle ne’er give o’er;
Renew the conflict ev’ry day,
And help divine implore.

Ne’er think the vict’ry won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
The work of faith will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown.

Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God;
He’ll take thee at thy parting breath
To His divine abode.

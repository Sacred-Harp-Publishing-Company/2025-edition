I soon shall view the prom-ised land,
I soon shall sing with the an-gels’ band,
For Je-sus’ blood has made me free;
And I soon shall sing in e-ter-ni-ty.

[chorus]
I want to live for Je-sus ev-’ry day,
I want to sing His prais-es once a-gain,
I want to feel that He is ev-er near
To guard and guide my wea-ry soul
To that e-ter-nal world of joy.

I soon shall view the promised land,
I soon shall sing with the angels’ band,
For Jesus’ blood has made me free;
And I soon shall sing in eternity.

[chorus]
I want to live for Jesus ev’ry day,
I want to sing His praises once again,
I want to feel that He is ever near
To guard and guide my weary soul
To that eternal world of joy.

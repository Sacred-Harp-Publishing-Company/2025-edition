# EXIT

Death, like an o-ver-flow-ing stream,
Sweeps us a-way; our life’s a dream,
An emp-ty tale, a morn-ing flow’r,
Cut down and with-ered in an hour.

Our age to sev’n-ty years is set;
How short the time! how frail the state!
And if to eight-y we ar-rive,
We rath-er sigh and groan than live.

Death, like an overflowing stream,
Sweeps us away; our life’s a dream,
An empty tale, a morning flow’r,
Cut down and withered in an hour.

Our age to sev’nty years is set;
How short the time! how frail the state!
And if to eighty we arrive,
We rather sigh and groan than live.

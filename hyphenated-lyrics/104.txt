# THE LOVELY STORY

A sto-ry most love-ly I’ll tell,
Of Je-sus (O won-drous sur-prise);
He suf-fered the tor-ments of hell,
That sin-ners, vile sin-ners, may rise;
He left His ex-alt-ed a-bode,
When man by trans-gres-sion was lost;
Ap-peas-ing the wrath of a God,
He shed forth His blood as the cost.

O did my dear Je-sus thus bleed,
And pit-y a ru-ined lost race!
O whence did such mer-cy pro-ceed,
Such bound-less com-pas-sion and grace!
His bod-y bore an-guish and pain,
His spir-it most sunk with the load,
A short time be-fore He was slain,
His sweat was as great drops of blood.

A story most lovely I’ll tell,
Of Jesus (O wondrous surprise);
He suffered the torments of hell,
That sinners, vile sinners, may rise;
He left His exalted abode,
When man by transgression was lost;
Appeasing the wrath of a God,
He shed forth His blood as the cost.

O did my dear Jesus thus bleed,
And pity a ruined lost race!
O whence did such mercy proceed,
Such boundless compassion and grace!
His body bore anguish and pain,
His spirit most sunk with the load,
A short time before He was slain,
His sweat was as great drops of blood.

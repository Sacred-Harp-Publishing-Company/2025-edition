Je-sus, grant us all a bless-ing;
Send it down, Lord, from a-bove;
May we all go home a-prais-ing
And re-joic-ing in Thy love.

[chorus]
Fare-well, breth-ren, fare-well, sis-ters,
Till we all shall meet a-gain.

Je-sus, par-don all our fol-ly,
Since to-geth-er we have been;
Make us hum-ble, make us ho-ly,
Cleanse us all from ev-’ry sin.

Jesus, grant us all a blessing;
Send it down, Lord, from above;
May we all go home a-praising
And rejoicing in Thy love.

[chorus]
Farewell, brethren, farewell, sisters,
Till we all shall meet again.

Jesus, pardon all our folly,
Since together we have been;
Make us humble, make us holy,
Cleanse us all from ev’ry sin.

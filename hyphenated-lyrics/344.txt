# RAINBOW

’Tis by Thy strength the moun-tains stand,
God of e-ter-nal pow’r!
The sea grows calm at Thy com-mand,
And tem-pests cease to roar.

The thirst-y ridg-es drink their fill,
And ranks of corn ap-pear.
Thy ways a-bound with bless-ings still,
Thy good-ness crowns the year.

’Tis by Thy strength the mountains stand,
God of eternal pow’r!
The sea grows calm at Thy command,
And tempests cease to roar.

The thirsty ridges drink their fill,
And ranks of corn appear.
Thy ways abound with blessings still,
Thy goodness crowns the year.

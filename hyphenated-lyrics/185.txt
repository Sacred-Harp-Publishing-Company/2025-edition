# PILGRIM’S FAREWELL

Fare-well, my friends, I must be gone;
I have no home or stay with you;
I’ll take my staff and trav-el on
Till I a bet-ter world can view.

[chorus]
I’ll march to Ca-naan’s land,
I’ll land on Ca-naan’s shore,
Where pleas-ures nev-er end,
And trou-bles come no more.
Fare-well, my lov-ing friends, fare-well.

Fare-well, my friends, time rolls a-long,
Nor waits for mor-tal cares or bliss;
I’ll leave you here and trav-el on
Till I ar-rive where Je-sus is.

Fare-well, dear breth-ren in the Lord,
To you I’m bound with cords of love;
But we be-lieve His gra-cious word,
We all ere long shall meet a-bove.

------

Farewell, my friends, I must be gone;
I have no home or stay with you;
I’ll take my staff and travel on
Till I a better world can view.

[chorus]
I’ll march to Canaan’s land,
I’ll land on Canaan’s shore,
Where pleasures never end,
And troubles come no more.
Farewell, my loving friends, farewell.

Farewell, my friends, time rolls along,
Nor waits for mortal cares or bliss;
I’ll leave you here and travel on
Till I arrive where Jesus is.

Farewell, dear brethren in the Lord,
To you I’m bound with cords of love;
But we believe His gracious word,
We all ere long shall meet above.

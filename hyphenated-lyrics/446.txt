# INFINITE DAY

There is a land of pure de-light
Where saints im-mor-tal reign;
In-fi-nite day ex-cludes the night,
And pleas-ures ban-ish pain.
There ev-er-last-ing spring a-bides,
And nev-er-with-’ring flow’rs;
Death, like a nar-row sea, di-vides
This heav’n-ly land from ours.

Oh, could we make our doubts re-move,
Those gloom-y doubts that rise,
And view the Ca-naan that we love
With un-be-cloud-ed eyes.
Could we but climb where Mo-ses stood
And view the land-scape o’er,
Not Jor-dan’s stream nor death’s cold flood
Should fright us from the shore.

There is a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.
There everlasting spring abides,
And never-with’ring flow’rs;
Death, like a narrow sea, divides
This heav’nly land from ours.

Oh, could we make our doubts remove,
Those gloomy doubts that rise,
And view the Canaan that we love
With unbeclouded eyes.
Could we but climb where Moses stood
And view the landscape o’er,
Not Jordan’s stream nor death’s cold flood
Should fright us from the shore.

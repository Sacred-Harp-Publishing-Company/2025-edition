# ODEM

Won-der-ful things of men are said
When they have passed a-way;
Flow-ers a-dorn the nar-row bed
O-ver the life-less clay.

[chorus]
Give me the ro-ses while I live,
Some-thing to cheer me on;
Use-less the flow-ers you may give
Af-ter the soul is gone.

Life is the time for words of praise,
Hands clasp with friend-ly smile;
Bless-ings to cheer a pil-grim’s days
Are al-ways well worth-while.

------

Wonderful things of men are said
When they have passed away;
Flowers adorn the narrow bed
Over the lifeless clay.

[chorus]
Give me the roses while I live,
Something to cheer me on;
Useless the flowers you may give
After the soul is gone.

Life is the time for words of praise,
Hands clasp with friendly smile;
Blessings to cheer a pilgrim’s days
Are always well worthwhile.

# VALE OF SORROW

While in this vale of sor-row,
I trav-el on in pain;
My heart is fixed on Je-sus,
I hope the prize to gain;
But when I come to bid a-dieu
To those I dear-ly love,
My heart is of-ten melt-ed—
It is the grief of love.

While in this vale of sorrow,
I travel on in pain;
My heart is fixed on Jesus,
I hope the prize to gain;
But when I come to bid adieu
To those I dearly love,
My heart is often melted—
It is the grief of love.

# THE HAPPY SAILOR

Come, tell of your ship, and what is her name?
Oh, tell me, hap-py sail-or!
Come, tell of your cap-tain, what is his fame?
Oh, tell me, hap-py sail-or!

[chorus]
She’s the old ship of Zi-on, hal-le-lu, hal-le-lu!
And her cap-tain Ju-dah’s Li-on, hal-le-lu-jah!

Say, is her keel sound, her gar-ner well stored?
Oh, tell me, hap-py sail-or!
And will she leave oth-er com-rades on board?
Oh, tell me, hap-py sail-or!

She will land us safe on Ca-naan’s bright shore,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
We’ll land with our friends who’ve gone on be-fore,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

Come, tell of your ship, and what is her name?
Oh, tell me, happy sailor!
Come, tell of your captain, what is his fame?
Oh, tell me, happy sailor!

[chorus]
She’s the old ship of Zion, hallelu, hallelu!
And her captain Judah’s Lion, hallelujah!

Say, is her keel sound, her garner well stored?
Oh, tell me, happy sailor!
And will she leave other comrades on board?
Oh, tell me, happy sailor!

She will land us safe on Canaan’s bright shore,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!
We’ll land with our friends who’ve gone on before,
Oh, glory, hallelujah!

# THE MERCY SEAT

From ev-’ry storm-y wind that blows,
From ev-’ry swell-ing tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure re-treat:
’Tis found be-neath the mer-cy seat.

[chorus]
There is a place where Je-sus sheds
The oil of glad-ness on our heads,
A place than all be-sides more sweet:
It is the blood-bought mer-cy seat.

There is a scene where spir-its blend,
Where friends hold fel-low-ship with friends;
Though sun-dered far, by faith they meet
A-round one com-mon mer-cy seat.

From ev’ry stormy wind that blows,
From ev’ry swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat:
’Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

[chorus]
There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet:
It is the blood-bought mercy seat.

There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friends hold fellowship with friends;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy seat.

# AMITY

How pleased and blest was I
To hear the peo-ple cry,
“Come, let us seek our God to-day!”
Yes, with a cheer-ful zeal
We haste to Zi-on’s hill,
And there our vows and hon-ors pay.

May peace at-tend thy gate,
And joy with-in thee wait,
To bless the soul of ev-’ry guest;
The man that seeks thy peace,
And wish-es thine in-crease,
A thou-sand bless-ings on him rest.

We haste to Zion’s hill,
And there our vows and honors pay.

May peace attend thy gate,
And joy within thee wait,
To bless the soul of ev’ry guest;
The man that seeks thy peace,
And wishes thine increase,
A thousand blessings on him rest.

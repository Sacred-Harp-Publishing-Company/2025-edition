# ROCKY ROAD

I’m en-list-ed on the road,
I’m al-most done trav-el-ing,
En-list-ed on the road,
I’m al-most done trav-el-ing,
I’m bound to go where Je-sus is.
My soul shall as-cend where Je-sus is
To en-joy the peace-ful home of rest,
I’m bound to go where Je-sus is
And be there for-ev-er blest.

[chorus]
It’s a might-y rock-y road,
I’m al-most done trav-el-ing,
A might-y rock-y road,
I’m al-most done trav-el-ing,
I’m bound to go where Je-sus is.

I’ve a fa-ther on the road,
He’s al-most done trav-el-ing,
A fa-ther on the road,
He’s al-most done trav-el-ing,
He’s bound to go where Je-sus is.
His soul shall as-cend where Je-sus is
To en-joy the peace-ful home of rest,
He’s bound to go where Je-sus is
And be there for-ev-er blest.

I’m enlisted on the road,
I’m almost done traveling,
Enlisted on the road,
I’m almost done traveling,
I’m bound to go where Jesus is.
My soul shall ascend where Jesus is
To enjoy the peaceful home of rest,
I’m bound to go where Jesus is
And be there forever blest.

[chorus]
It’s a mighty rocky road,
I’m almost done traveling,
A mighty rocky road,
I’m almost done traveling,
I’m bound to go where Jesus is.

I’ve a father on the road,
He’s almost done traveling,
A father on the road,
He’s almost done traveling,
He’s bound to go where Jesus is.
His soul shall ascend where Jesus is
To enjoy the peaceful home of rest,
He’s bound to go where Jesus is
And be there forever blest.

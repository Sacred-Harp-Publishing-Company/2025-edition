Let ev-’ry crea-ture join
To praise th’e-ter-nal God;
Ye heav’n-ly hosts, the song be-gin,
And sound His name a-broad.
Thou sun with gold-en beams,
And moon with pal-er rays;
Ye star-ry lights, ye twin-kling flames,
Shine to your Mak-er’s praise.

Let ev’ry creature join
To praise th’eternal God;
Ye heav’nly hosts, the song begin,
And sound His name abroad.
Thou sun with golden beams,
And moon with paler rays;
Ye starry lights, ye twinkling flames,
Shine to your Maker’s praise.

# ROLL ON

Why should we start and fear to die?
What tim-’rous worms we mor-tals are!
Death is the gate of end-less joy,
And yet we dread to en-ter there.

[chorus]
Roll on, roll on, sweet mo-ments roll on,
And let the poor pil-grim go home, go home.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fear-less through death’s i-ron gate,
Nor feel the ter-rors as she passed.

Why should we start and fear to die?
What tim’rous worms we mortals are!
Death is the gate of endless joy,
And yet we dread to enter there.

[chorus]
Roll on, roll on, sweet moments roll on,
And let the poor pilgrim go home, go home.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fearless through death’s iron gate,
Nor feel the terrors as she passed.

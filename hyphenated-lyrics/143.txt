# PLEYEL’S HYMN SECOND

While Thee I seek, pro-tect-ing Pow’r,
Be my vain wish-es stilled,
And may this con-se-crat-ed hour
With bet-ter hopes be filled.
Thy love the pow’r of thought be-stowed,
To Thee my thoughts would soar;
Thy mer-cy o’er my life has flowed,
That mer-cy I a-dore.

In each e-vent of life, how clear
Thy rul-ing hand I see!
Each bless-ing to my soul more dear,
Be-cause con-ferred by Thee.
In ev-’ry joy that crowns my days,
In ev-’ry pain I bear,
My heart shall find de-light in praise,
Or seek re-lief in prayer.

When glad-ness wings my fa-vored hour,
Thy love my thoughts shall fill;
Re-signed when storms of sor-row low’r,
My soul shall meet Thy will.
My lift-ed eye, with-out a tear,
The gath-’ring storm shall see:
My stead-fast heart shall know no fear;
That heart shall rest on Thee.

------

While Thee I seek, protecting Pow’r,
Be my vain wishes stilled,
And may this consecrated hour
With better hopes be filled.
Thy love the pow’r of thought bestowed,
To Thee my thoughts would soar;
Thy mercy o’er my life has flowed,
That mercy I adore.

In each event of life, how clear
Thy ruling hand I see!
Each blessing to my soul more dear,
Because conferred by Thee.
In ev’ry joy that crowns my days,
In ev’ry pain I bear,
My heart shall find delight in praise,
Or seek relief in prayer.

When gladness wings my favored hour,
Thy love my thoughts shall fill;
Resigned when storms of sorrow low’r,
My soul shall meet Thy will.
My lifted eye, without a tear,
The gath’ring storm shall see:
My steadfast heart shall know no fear;
That heart shall rest on Thee.

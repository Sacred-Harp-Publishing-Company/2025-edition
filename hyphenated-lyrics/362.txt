Oh, the de-lights, the heav’n-ly joys,
The glo-ries of the place
Where Je-sus sheds the bright-est beams
Of His o’er-flow-ing grace!
Sweet maj-es-ty and aw-ful love
Sit smil-ing on His brow,
And all the glo-rious ranks a-bove
At hum-ble dis-tance bow.

Oh, the delights, the heav’nly joys,
The glories of the place
Where Jesus sheds the brightest beams
Of His o’erflowing grace!
Sweet majesty and awful love
Sit smiling on His brow,
And all the glorious ranks above
At humble distance bow.

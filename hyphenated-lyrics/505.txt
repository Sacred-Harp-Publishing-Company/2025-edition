# WHERE CEASELESS AGES ROLL

Come on, my friends, and go with me,
For I am on my jour-ney home;
My Sav-ior wel-comes you with me
To live where joys are ev-er known.

[chorus]
Come, go with me to that fair land
Where cease-less ag-es roll, and roll,
Where cease-less ag-es roll.

------

Come on, my friends, and go with me,
For I am on my journey home;
My Savior welcomes you with me
To live where joys are ever known.

[chorus]
Come, go with me to that fair land
Where ceaseless ages roll, and roll,
Where ceaseless ages roll.

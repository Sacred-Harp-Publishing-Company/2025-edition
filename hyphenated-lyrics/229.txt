What poor, de-spis-ed com-pa-ny
Of trav-el-ers are these,
That walk in yon-der nar-row way,
A-long the rug-ged maze?
Ah, they are of a roy-al line,
All chil-dren of a King,
Heirs of im-mor-tal crowns di-vine,
And loud for joy they sing.

What poor, despised company
Of travelers are these,
That walk in yonder narrow way,
Along the rugged maze?
Ah, they are of a royal line,
All children of a King,
Heirs of immortal crowns divine,
And loud for joy they sing.

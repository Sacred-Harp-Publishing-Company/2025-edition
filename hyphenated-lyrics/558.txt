# LIVING STREAMS

My Shep-herd is the Lord most high,
And all my wants He will sup-ply;
In pas-tures green He makes me lie,
And leads by streams that nev-er die.
He in His mer-cy doth re-store
My soul when sink-ing in dis-tress;
For His name’s sake He ev-er-more
Leads me in paths of right-eous-ness.

Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
E’en there no e-vil shall I fear,
Be-cause Thy pres-ence shall not fail;
Thy rod and staff my soul shall cheer.
For me a ta-ble Thou hast spread
Be-fore the fac-es of my foes;
With oil Thou dost a-noint my head,
My cup is full and o-ver-flows.

My Shepherd is the Lord most high,
And all my wants He will supply;
In pastures green He makes me lie,
And leads by streams that never die.
He in His mercy doth restore
My soul when sinking in distress;
For His name’s sake He evermore
Leads me in paths of righteousness.

Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
E’en there no evil shall I fear,
Because Thy presence shall not fail;
Thy rod and staff my soul shall cheer.
For me a table Thou hast spread
Before the faces of my foes;
With oil Thou dost anoint my head,
My cup is full and overflows.

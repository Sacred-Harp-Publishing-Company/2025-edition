# RELIGION IS A FORTUNE

O when shall I see Je-sus,
And reign with Him a-bove?
Shout glo-ry, hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.
And from the flow-ing foun-tain
Drink ev-er-last-ing love?
Shout glo-ry, hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.

[chorus]
When we all get to heav-en,
We will shout a-loud and sing,
Shout glo-ry, hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.
Re-li-gion is a for-tune,
And heav-en is a home,
Shout glo-ry, hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.

When shall I be de-liv-ered
From this vain world of sin?
Shout glo-ry, hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.
And with my bless-ed Je-sus
Drink end-less pleas-ures in?
Shout glo-ry, hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above?
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love?
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.

[chorus]
When we all get to heaven,
We will shout aloud and sing,
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.
Religion is a fortune,
And heaven is a home,
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.

When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin?
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in?
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.

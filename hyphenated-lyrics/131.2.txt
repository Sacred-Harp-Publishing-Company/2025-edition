# INVOCATION

Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
Thy bet-ter por-tion trace;
Rise from tran-si-to-ry things
To heav’n, thy na-tive place.
Sun and moon and stars de-cay,
Time shall soon this earth re-move;
Rise, my soul, and haste a-way
To seats pre-pared a-bove.

Cease, ye pil-grims, cease to mourn,
Press on-ward to the prize;
Soon our Sav-ior will re-turn,
Tri-um-phant in the skies.
Yet a sea-son, and you know,
Hap-py en-trance will be giv’n,
All our sor-rows left be-low,
And earth ex-changed for heav’n.

------

Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
Thy better portion trace;
Rise from transitory things
To heav’n, thy native place.
Sun and moon and stars decay,
Time shall soon this earth remove;
Rise, my soul, and haste away
To seats prepared above.

Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn,
Press onward to the prize;
Soon our Savior will return,
Triumphant in the skies.
Yet a season, and you know,
Happy entrance will be giv’n,
All our sorrows left below,
And earth exchanged for heav’n.

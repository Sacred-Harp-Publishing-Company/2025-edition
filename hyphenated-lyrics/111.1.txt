# JOURNEY HOME

Oh, who will come and go with me?
I’m on my jour-ney home.
I’m bound fair Ca-naan’s land to see,
I’m on my jour-ney home.

[chorus]
Oh, come and go with me,
For I’m on my jour-ney home,
Home, sweet home,
Bless the Lord.

E-ter-nal Spir-it, we con-fess,
I’m on my jour-ney home.
And sing the won-ders of Thy grace,
I’m on my jour-ney home.

Thy pow’r con-veys our bless-ings down,
I’m on my jour-ney home.
From God the Fa-ther and the Son,
I’m on my jour-ney home.

Oh, who will come and go with me?
I’m on my journey home.
I’m bound fair Canaan’s land to see,
I’m on my journey home.

[chorus]
Oh, come and go with me,
For I’m on my journey home,
Home, sweet home,
Bless the Lord.

Eternal Spirit, we confess,
I’m on my journey home.
And sing the wonders of Thy grace,
I’m on my journey home.

Thy pow’r conveys our blessings down,
I’m on my journey home.
From God the Father and the Son,
I’m on my journey home.

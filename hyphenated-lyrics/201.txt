# PILGRIM

Come, all ye mourn-ing pil-grims dear,
Who’re bound for Ca-naan’s land;
Take cour-age and fight val-iant-ly;
Stand fast with sword in hand.
Our Cap-tain’s gone be-fore us,
Our Fa-ther’s on-ly Son;
Then, pil-grims dear, pray do not fear,
But let us fol-low on.

Come, all ye mourning pilgrims dear,
Who’re bound for Canaan’s land;
Take courage and fight valiantly;
Stand fast with sword in hand.
Our Captain’s gone before us,
Our Father’s only Son;
Then, pilgrims dear, pray do not fear,
But let us follow on.

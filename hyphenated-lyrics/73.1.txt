# CUSSETA

Show pit-y, Lord; O Lord, for-give;
Let a re-pent-ing re-bel live:
Are not Thy mer-cies large and free?
May not a sin-ner trust in Thee?

My crimes, though great, can-not sur-pass
The pow’r and glo-ry of Thy grace;
Great God, Thy na-ture hath no bound;
So let Thy par-d’ning love be found.

Yet save a trem-bling sin-ner, Lord,
Whose hope, still hov-’ring round Thy word,
Would light on some sweet prom-ise there,
Some sure sup-port a-gainst de-spair.

Show pity, Lord; O Lord, forgive;
Let a repenting rebel live:
Are not Thy mercies large and free?
May not a sinner trust in Thee?

My crimes, though great, cannot surpass
The pow’r and glory of Thy grace;
Great God, Thy nature hath no bound;
So let Thy pard’ning love be found.

Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,
Whose hope, still hov’ring round Thy word,
Would light on some sweet promise there,
Some sure support against despair.

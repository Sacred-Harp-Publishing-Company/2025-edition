Time, like an ev-er-roll-ing stream,
Bears all its sons a-way;
They fly, for-got-ten, as a dream
Dies at the op-’ning day.

Our God, our help in ag-es past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while trou-bles last,
And our e-ter-nal home.

Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly, forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the op’ning day.

Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
And our eternal home.

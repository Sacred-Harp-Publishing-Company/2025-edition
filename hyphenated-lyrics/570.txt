# SLEEPERS AWAKE!

A-rise, my soul, a-wake, my voice,
And tunes of pleas-ure sing;
Loud hal-le-lu-jahs shall ad-dress
My Sav-ior and my King.
A-rise, my soul, my joy-ful pow’rs,
And tri-umph in my God;

[solos]
A-wake!

A-wake, my voice,
And loud pro-claim His grace a-broad.

------

Arise, my soul, awake, my voice,
And tunes of pleasure sing;
Loud hallelujahs shall address
My Savior and my King.
Arise, my soul, my joyful pow’rs,
And triumph in my God;

[solos]
Awake!

Awake, my voice,
And loud proclaim His grace abroad.

# MOUNT VERNON

What sol-emn sounds the ear in-vade,
What wraps the land in sor-row’s shade?
From heav’n the aw-ful man-date flies,
The fa-ther of his coun-try dies.
Where shall our na-tion turn its eye,
What help re-mains be-neath the sky?
Our friend, pro-tec-tor, strength, and trust,
Lies low and mold-’ring in the dust.

------

What solemn sounds the ear invade,
What wraps the land in sorrow’s shade?
From heav’n the awful mandate flies,
The father of his country dies.
Where shall our nation turn its eye,
What help remains beneath the sky?
Our friend, protector, strength, and trust,
Lies low and mold’ring in the dust.

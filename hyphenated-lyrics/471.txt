In-crease, O Lord, our faith and hope,
And fit us to as-cend
Where the as-sem-bly ne’er breaks up,
And sab-baths nev-er end.

When I ap-pear in yon-der cloud,
With all the sa-cred throng,
Then I will sing more sweet, more loud,
And Christ will be my song.

Increase, O Lord, our faith and hope,
And fit us to ascend
Where the assembly ne’er breaks up,
And sabbaths never end.

When I appear in yonder cloud,
With all the sacred throng,
Then I will sing more sweet, more loud,
And Christ will be my song.

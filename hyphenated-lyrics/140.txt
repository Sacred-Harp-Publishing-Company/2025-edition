# MORENO

Fare-well, dear breth-ren of the Lord,
And I can-not tar-ry here with you!
Yet we be-lieve His gra-cious word,
And I can-not tar-ry here with you!

[chorus]
I want to hear the sto-ry,
And I want to go in glo-ry!
The gos-pel sounds the ju-bi-lee!

Fare-well, my earth-ly friends be-low,
And I can-not tar-ry here with you!
My Sav-ior calls, and I must go,
And I can-not tar-ry here with you!

Fare-well to all be-low the sun,
And I can-not tar-ry here with you!
The path is straight my feet shall run,
And I can-not tar-ry here with you!

------

Farewell, dear brethren of the Lord,
And I cannot tarry here with you!
Yet we believe His gracious word,
And I cannot tarry here with you!

[chorus]
I want to hear the story,
And I want to go in glory!
The gospel sounds the jubilee!

Farewell, my earthly friends below,
And I cannot tarry here with you!
My Savior calls, and I must go,
And I cannot tarry here with you!

Farewell to all below the sun,
And I cannot tarry here with you!
The path is straight my feet shall run,
And I cannot tarry here with you!

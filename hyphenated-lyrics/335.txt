# RETURN AGAIN

Sav-ior, vis-it Thy plan-ta-tion;
Grant us Lord, a gra-cious rain.
All will come to des-o-la-tion,
Un-less Thou re-turn a-gain.

[chorus]
Lord, re-vive us! Lord, re-vive us!
All our help must come from Thee;
Lord, re-vive us! O re-vive us!
All our help must come from Thee.

Keep no long-er at a dis-tance;
Shine up-on us from on high.
Lest for want of Thy as-sis-tance,
Ev-’ry plant should droop and die.

------

Savior, visit Thy plantation;
Grant us Lord, a gracious rain.
All will come to desolation,
Unless Thou return again.

[chorus]
Lord, revive us! Lord, revive us!
All our help must come from Thee;
Lord, revive us! O revive us!
All our help must come from Thee.

Keep no longer at a distance;
Shine upon us from on high.
Lest for want of Thy assistance,
Ev’ry plant should droop and die.

# HAPPY LAND

There is a hap-py land,
Far, far a-way,
Where saints in glo-ry stand,
Bright, bright as day.
Oh, how they sweet-ly sing,
Wor-thy is our Sav-ior King;
Loud let His prais-es ring,
Praise, praise for aye.

Come to that hap-py land;
Come, come a-way.
Why will ye doubt-ing stand;
Why yet de-lay?
Oh, we shall hap-py be
When from sin and sor-row free;
Lord we shall live with Thee,
Blest, blest for aye.

Bright in that hap-py land
Beams ev-’ry eye;
Kept by a Fa-ther’s hand,
Love can-not die.
Then shall His king-dom come;
Saints shall share a glo-rious home,
And bright a-bove the sun,
We’ll reign for aye.

There is a happy land,
Far, far away,
Where saints in glory stand,
Bright, bright as day.
Oh, how they sweetly sing,
Worthy is our Savior King;
Loud let His praises ring,
Praise, praise for aye.

Come to that happy land;
Come, come away.
Why will ye doubting stand;
Why yet delay?
Oh, we shall happy be
When from sin and sorrow free;
Lord we shall live with Thee,
Blest, blest for aye.

Bright in that happy land
Beams ev’ry eye;
Kept by a Father’s hand,
Love cannot die.
Then shall His kingdom come;
Saints shall share a glorious home,
And bright above the sun,
We’ll reign for aye.

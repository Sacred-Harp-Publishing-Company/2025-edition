# THE GOOD OLD WAY

Lift up your heads, Im-man-uel’s friends,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah,
And taste the pleas-ure Je-sus sends,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.
Let noth-ing cause you to de-lay,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah:
But has-ten on the good old way,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.

Our con-flicts here, though great they be,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah,
Shall not pre-vent our vic-to-ry,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.
If we but strive and watch and pray,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah:
Like sol-diers in the good old way,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.

Though Sa-tan may his pow’r em-ploy,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah,
Our hap-pi-ness for to de-stroy,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.
Yet nev-er fear, we’ll gain the day,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah:
And shout and sing the good old way,
O hal-le, hal-le-lu-jah.

Lift up your heads, Immanuel’s friends,
O halle, hallelujah,
And taste the pleasure Jesus sends,
O halle, hallelujah.
Let nothing cause you to delay,
O halle, hallelujah:
But hasten on the good old way,
O halle, hallelujah.

Our conflicts here, though great they be,
O halle, hallelujah,
Shall not prevent our victory,
O halle, hallelujah.
If we but strive and watch and pray,
O halle, hallelujah:
Like soldiers in the good old way,
O halle, hallelujah.

Though Satan may his pow’r employ,
O halle, hallelujah,
Our happiness for to destroy,
O halle, hallelujah.
Yet never fear, we’ll gain the day,
O halle, hallelujah:
And shout and sing the good old way,
O halle, hallelujah.

Do not I love Thee, O my Lord?
Be-hold my heart and see,
And turn each curs-ed i-dol out
That dares to ri-val Thee.

Do not I love Thee from my soul?
Then let me noth-ing love;
Dead be my heart to ev-’ry joy
When Je-sus can-not move.

Thou know’st I love Thee, dear-est Lord,
But O I long to soar
Far from the sphere of mor-tal joys,
And learn to love Thee more.

Do not I love Thee, O my Lord?
Behold my heart and see,
And turn each cursed idol out
That dares to rival Thee.

Do not I love Thee from my soul?
Then let me nothing love;
Dead be my heart to ev’ry joy
When Jesus cannot move.

Thou know’st I love Thee, dearest Lord,
But O I long to soar
Far from the sphere of mortal joys,
And learn to love Thee more.

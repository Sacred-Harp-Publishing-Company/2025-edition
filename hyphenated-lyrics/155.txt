How long, dear Sav-ior, O how long
Shall this bright hour de-lay?
Fly swift a-round, ye wheels of time,
And bring the prom-ised day.

From the third heav’n where God re-sides,
That ho-ly, hap-py place,
The New Je-ru-sa-lem comes down,
A-dorned with shin-ing grace.

How long, dear Savior, O how long
Shall this bright hour delay?
Fly swift around, ye wheels of time,
And bring the promised day.

From the third heav’n where God resides,
That holy, happy place,
The New Jerusalem comes down,
Adorned with shining grace.

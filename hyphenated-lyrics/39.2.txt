Blest Je-sus, while in mor-tal flesh
I hold my frail a-bode,
Still would my spir-it rest on Thee,
My Sav-ior and my God.

On Thy dear cross I fix my eyes,
My trust on Thee com-plete,
Till love dis-solves my in-most soul
At my Re-deem-er’s feet.

Be dead, my heart, to world-ly charms,
Be dead to ev-’ry sin;
And tell the bold-est foe with-out
That Je-sus reigns with-in.

Blest Jesus, while in mortal flesh
I hold my frail abode,
Still would my spirit rest on Thee,
My Savior and my God.

On Thy dear cross I fix my eyes,
My trust on Thee complete,
Till love dissolves my inmost soul
At my Redeemer’s feet.

Be dead, my heart, to worldly charms,
Be dead to ev’ry sin;
And tell the boldest foe without
That Jesus reigns within.

# MINK HOLLOW

Lay Thy sup-port-ing, gen-tle hand
Be-neath my sink-ing head,
And let a beam of life di-vine
Il-lume my dy-ing bed.
I could re-nounce my all be-low
If my Re-deem-er bid,
And run, if I were called to go,
And die as Mo-ses did.

Oh, for an o-ver-com-ing faith
To cheer my dy-ing hours,
To tri-umph o’er the mon-ster, death,
And all his fright-ful pow’rs.
If I must die, and die I must,
Let some kind ser-aph come,
And bear me on his friend-ly wing
To my e-ter-nal home.

------

Lay Thy supporting, gentle hand
Beneath my sinking head,
And let a beam of life divine
Illume my dying bed.
I could renounce my all below
If my Redeemer bid,
And run, if I were called to go,
And die as Moses did.

Oh, for an overcoming faith
To cheer my dying hours,
To triumph o’er the monster, death,
And all his frightful pow’rs.
If I must die, and die I must,
Let some kind seraph come,
And bear me on his friendly wing
To my eternal home.

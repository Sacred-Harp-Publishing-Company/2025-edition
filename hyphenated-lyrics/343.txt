# HAPPY HOME

Oh yes, my Sav-ior I will trust,
And though my bod-y turns to dust,

[chorus]
Oh, what a hap-py time, when the Chris-tians all get home,
And we’ll shout and praise the Lamb in glo-ry!

My spir-it shall fly out and sing
E-ter-nal prais-es to my King;

------

Oh yes, my Savior I will trust,
And though my body turns to dust,

[chorus]
Oh, what a happy time, when the Christians all get home,
And we’ll shout and praise the Lamb in glory!

My spirit shall fly out and sing
Eternal praises to my King;

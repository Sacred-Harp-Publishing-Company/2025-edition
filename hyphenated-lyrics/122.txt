# ALL IS WELL

What’s this that steals, that steals up-on my frame?
Is it death, is it death?
That soon will quench, will quench this mor-tal flame,
Is it death, is it death?
If this be death, I soon shall be
From ev-’ry pain and sor-row free;
I shall the King of glo-ry see;
All is well, all is well!

Weep not, my friends, my friends, weep not for me,
All is well, all is well!
My sins for-giv’n, for-giv’n, and I am free,
All is well, all is well!
There’s not a cloud that doth a-rise
To hide my Je-sus from my eyes;
I soon shall mount the up-per skies;
All is well, all is well!

Hark! hark! my Lord, my Lord and Mas-ter’s voice
Calls a-way, calls a-way!
I soon shall see—en-joy my hap-py choice;
Why de-lay, why de-lay?
Fare-well, my friends, a-dieu, a-dieu,
I can no long-er stay with you;
My glit-t’ring crown ap-pears in view;
All is well, all is well!

What’s this that steals, that steals upon my frame?
Is it death, is it death?
That soon will quench, will quench this mortal flame,
Is it death, is it death?
If this be death, I soon shall be
From ev’ry pain and sorrow free;
I shall the King of glory see;
All is well, all is well!

Weep not, my friends, my friends, weep not for me,
All is well, all is well!
My sins forgiv’n, forgiv’n, and I am free,
All is well, all is well!
There’s not a cloud that doth arise
To hide my Jesus from my eyes;
I soon shall mount the upper skies;
All is well, all is well!

Hark! hark! my Lord, my Lord and Master’s voice
Calls away, calls away!
I soon shall see—enjoy my happy choice;
Why delay, why delay?
Farewell, my friends, adieu, adieu,
I can no longer stay with you;
My glitt’ring crown appears in view;
All is well, all is well!

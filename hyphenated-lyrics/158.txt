# FUNERAL THOUGHT

Thou art gone to the grave, but we will not de-plore thee,
Though sor-rows and dark-ness en-com-pass the tomb;
The Sav-ior has passed through its por-tals be-fore thee,
And the lamp of His love is thy guide through the gloom.

Thou art gone to the grave—we no long-er be-hold thee,
Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side;
But wide arms of mer-cy are spread to en-fold thee,
And all sin-ners may hope, since the Sav-ior hath died.

Thou art gone to the grave, and thy cra-dle’s for-sak-en;
With us thy fond spir-it did not tar-ry long,
But sun-shine of heav-en beamed bright on thy wak-ing,
And the sound thou didst hear was the ser-a-phim’s song.

Thou art gone to the grave, but ’twere wrong to de-plore thee,
When God was thy ran-som, and guard-ian, and guide;
He gave thee, and took thee, and soon will re-store thee,
Where death hath no sting, since the Sav-ior hath died.

Thou art gone to the grave, but we will not deplore thee,
Though sorrows and darkness encompass the tomb;
The Savior has passed through its portals before thee,
And the lamp of His love is thy guide through the gloom.

Thou art gone to the grave—we no longer behold thee,
Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side;
But wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee,
And all sinners may hope, since the Savior hath died.

Thou art gone to the grave, and thy cradle’s forsaken;
With us thy fond spirit did not tarry long,
But sunshine of heaven beamed bright on thy waking,
And the sound thou didst hear was the seraphim’s song.

Thou art gone to the grave, but ’twere wrong to deplore thee,
When God was thy ransom, and guardian, and guide;
He gave thee, and took thee, and soon will restore thee,
Where death hath no sting, since the Savior hath died.

# MOURNFUL JOY

A-las! I knew not what I did;
But now my tears are vain:
Where shall my trem-bling soul be hid?
For I the Lord have slain!
Thus, while His death my sin dis-plays
In all its black-est hue,
Such is the mys-t’ry of His grace,
It seals my par-don too.

Alas! I knew not what I did;
But now my tears are vain:
Where shall my trembling soul be hid?
For I the Lord have slain!
Thus, while His death my sin displays
In all its blackest hue,
Such is the myst’ry of His grace,
It seals my pardon too.

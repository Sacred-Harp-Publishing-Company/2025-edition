# SOAR AWAY

I want a so-ber mind,
An all-sus-tain-ing eye,
To see my God a-bove,
And to the heav-ens fly.

[chorus]
I’d soar a-way a-bove the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God a-bove.

I want a god-ly fear,
A quick, dis-cern-ing eye
That looks to Thee, my God,
And sees the tempt-er fly.

[chorus: treble]
I’d soar a-way a-bove the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God a-bove,
I’d fly,
To see my God a-bove.

[chorus: alto]
I’d soar a-way a-bove the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God a-bove,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God a-bove.

[chorus: tenor, bass]
I’d soar a-way a-bove the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God a-bove,
I’d fly, fly, fly,
To see my God a-bove.

------

I want a sober mind,
An all-sustaining eye,
To see my God above,
And to the heavens fly.

[chorus]
I’d soar away above the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above.

I want a godly fear,
A quick, discerning eye
That looks to Thee, my God,
And sees the tempter fly.

[chorus: treble]
I’d soar away above the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above,
I’d fly,
To see my God above.

[chorus: alto]
I’d soar away above the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above.

[chorus: tenor, bass]
I’d soar away above the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above,
I’d fly, fly, fly,
To see my God above.

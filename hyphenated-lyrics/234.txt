# REVERENTIAL ANTHEM

Give un-to the Lord the glo-ry due un-to His name;
Come in-to His courts,
Wor-ship the Lord in the beau-ty of ho-li-ness.
Fear be-fore Him, all the earth.
He shall judge the peo-ple right-eous-ly.
Let the heav’ns re-joice,
And the earth be glad be-fore the Lord.
[bass solo] For he com-eth,
[tenor solo] For he com-eth,
[treble solo] For he com-eth
To judge the world with right-eous-ness, and the peo-ple with His truth.

------

Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His name;
Come into His courts,
Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.
Fear before Him, all the earth.
He shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heav’ns rejoice,
And the earth be glad before the Lord.
[bass solo] For he cometh,
[tenor solo] For he cometh,
[treble solo] For he cometh
To judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His truth.

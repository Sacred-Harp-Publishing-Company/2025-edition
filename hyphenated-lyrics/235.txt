# LONG SOUGHT HOME

Je-ru-sa-lem! my hap-py home!
Oh, how I long for thee!
When will my sor-rows have an end?
Thy joys when shall I see?

[chorus]
Home, sweet home, my long-sought home,
My home in heav’n a-bove.

Thy walls are all of pre-cious stones,
Most glo-rious to be-hold!
Thy gates are rich-ly set with pearl,
Thy streets are paved with gold.

My friends, I bid you all a-dieu;
I leave you in God’s care;
And if I here no more see you,
Go on; I’ll meet you there.

Jerusalem! my happy home!
Oh, how I long for thee!
When will my sorrows have an end?
Thy joys when shall I see?

[chorus]
Home, sweet home, my long-sought home,
My home in heav’n above.

Thy walls are all of precious stones,
Most glorious to behold!
Thy gates are richly set with pearl,
Thy streets are paved with gold.

My friends, I bid you all adieu;
I leave you in God’s care;
And if I here no more see you,
Go on; I’ll meet you there.

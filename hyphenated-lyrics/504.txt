# WOOD STREET

When we, our wea-ried limbs to rest,
Sat down by proud Eu-phra-tes’ stream,
We wept with dole-ful thoughts op-pressed,
And Zi-on was our mourn-ful theme.

Our harps, that when with joy we sung
Were wont their tune-ful parts to bear,
With si-lent strings ne-glect-ed hung
On wil-low trees that with-ered there.

When we, our wearied limbs to rest,
Sat down by proud Euphrates’ stream,
We wept with doleful thoughts oppressed,
And Zion was our mournful theme.

Our harps, that when with joy we sung
Were wont their tuneful parts to bear,
With silent strings neglected hung
On willow trees that withered there.

# TURN, SINNER, TURN

To-day, if you will hear His voice,
Now is the time to make your choice;
Say, will you to Mount Zi-on go?
Say, will you have this Christ, or no?

[chorus]
Oh! turn, sin-ner, turn,
May the Lord help you turn!
Oh! turn, sin-ner, turn,
Why will you die?

Today, if you will hear His voice,
Now is the time to make your choice;
Say, will you to Mount Zion go?
Say, will you have this Christ, or no?

[chorus]
Oh! turn, sinner, turn,
May the Lord help you turn!
Oh! turn, sinner, turn,
Why will you die?

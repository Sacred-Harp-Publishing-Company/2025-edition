# WORLD UNKNOWN

And am I born to die?
To lay this bod-y down?
And must my trem-bling spir-it fly
In-to a world un-known?

Waked by the trum-pet’s sound,
I from my grave shall rise,
And see the Judge with glo-ry crowned,
And see the flam-ing skies!

And am I born to die?
To lay this body down?
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown?

Waked by the trumpet’s sound,
I from my grave shall rise,
And see the Judge with glory crowned,
And see the flaming skies!

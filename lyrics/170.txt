# EXHILARATION

O may I worthy prove to see
The saints in full prosperity.
Then my troubles will be over.
To see the bride, the glitt’ring bride,
Close seated by my Savior’s side.
Then my troubles will be over.

[chorus]
I never shall forget the day
When Jesus washed my sins away,
And then my troubles will be over,
Will be over,
Will be over,
And rejoicing,
And then my troubles will be over.

I’ll praise Him while He gives me breath,
I hope to praise Him after death.
Then my troubles will be over.
I hope to praise Him when I die,
And shout salvation as I fly!
Then my troubles will be over.

I soon shall pass the vale of death,
And in His arms resign my breath.
Then my troubles will be over.
O then my happy soul shall tell
My Jesus has done all things well.
Then my troubles will be over.

# THE GOOD OLD WAY

Lift up your heads, Immanuel’s friends,
O halle, hallelujah,
And taste the pleasure Jesus sends,
O halle, hallelujah.
Let nothing cause you to delay,
O halle, hallelujah:
But hasten on the good old way,
O halle, hallelujah.

Our conflicts here, though great they be,
O halle, hallelujah,
Shall not prevent our victory,
O halle, hallelujah.
If we but strive and watch and pray,
O halle, hallelujah:
Like soldiers in the good old way,
O halle, hallelujah.

Though Satan may his pow’r employ,
O halle, hallelujah,
Our happiness for to destroy,
O halle, hallelujah.
Yet never fear, we’ll gain the day,
O halle, hallelujah:
And shout and sing the good old way,
O halle, hallelujah.

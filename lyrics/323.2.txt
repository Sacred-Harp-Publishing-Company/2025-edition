When blooming youth is snatched away
By death’s resistless hand,
Our hearts the mournful tribute pay
Which pity must demand.

Let this vain world engage no more:
Behold the gaping tomb!
It bids us seize the present hour—
Tomorrow death may come.

Hope looks beyond the bounds of time,
When what we now deplore
Shall rise in full immortal prime,
And bloom to fade no more.

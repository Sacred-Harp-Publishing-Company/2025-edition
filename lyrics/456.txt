# SACRED MOUNT

Sing, O ye ransomed of the Lord,
Your great Redeemer sing.

[chorus]
Pilgrims for Zion’s city bound,
Be joyful in your King;
A hand divine shall lead you on,
Through all the blissful road,
Till to the sacred mount you rise,
And see your smiling God.

March on in your Redeemer’s strength,
Pursue His footsteps still.

# JEWETT

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

[chorus]
Shout, shout for glory,
Shout, shout aloud for glory;
Brother, sister, mourner,
All shout glory, hallelujah!

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
’Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

The earth will soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.

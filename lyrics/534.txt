# NEW GEORGIA

The mighty hand of God doth reign,
As in the ages past;
His blood has entered death’s domain
To guide us home at last.
His praise we’ll sing the earth around,
His praise we’ll sing,
And upward lift our eyes,
While slumb’ring tenants of the ground
In living armies rise.

When sun and moon, and earth, and stars,
And time shall be no more,
Through His own blood and battle scars
We’ll land on Canaan’s shore.
His praise forever we shall sing,
His praise we’ll sing,
And mount the upper sky,
And to the palace of our King
On wings of love we’ll fly.

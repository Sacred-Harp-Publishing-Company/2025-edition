# O’LEARY

And will the Judge descend,
And must the dead arise,
And not a single soul escape
His all-discerning eyes?

How will my heart endure
The terrors of that day,
When earth and heav’n before His face
Astonished shrink away?

But ere the trumpet shakes
The mansions of the dead,
Hark, from the gospel’s cheering sound,
What joyful tidings spread.

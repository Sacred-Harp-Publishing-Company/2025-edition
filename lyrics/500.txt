# LIVING HOPE

Blest be the everlasting God,
The Father of our Lord;
Be His abounding mercy praised,
His majesty adored.

[chorus]
When from the dead He raised His Son
And called Him to the sky,
He gave our souls a living hope
That they should never die.

Saints by the powâ€™r of God are kept
Till the salvation come;
We walk by faith as strangers here,
Till Christ shall call us home.

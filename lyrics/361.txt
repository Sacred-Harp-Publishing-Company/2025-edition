# LOVING JESUS

Here’s my heart, my loving Jesus—
Thou who didst from sin relieve us;
Take the purchase of Thy blood!
Loving Jesus, Thou hast bought a ransom!

[treble, tenor]
Glory, glory, honor, praise, and power,
Glory, glory to the Lord!

[alto, bass]
Glory, honor, praise, and power
Be unto the Lamb forever!
Glory, glory to the Lord!

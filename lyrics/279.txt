# MINK HOLLOW

Lay Thy supporting, gentle hand
Beneath my sinking head,
And let a beam of life divine
Illume my dying bed.
I could renounce my all below
If my Redeemer bid,
And run, if I were called to go,
And die as Moses did.

Oh, for an overcoming faith
To cheer my dying hours,
To triumph o’er the monster, death,
And all his frightful pow’rs.
If I must die, and die I must,
Let some kind seraph come,
And bear me on his friendly wing
To my eternal home.

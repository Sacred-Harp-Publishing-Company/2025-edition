# KEDRON

Thou Man of grief, remember me,
Who never canst Thyself forget
Thy last expiring agony,
Thy fainting pangs and bloody sweat.

Father, if I may call Thee so,
Regard my fearful heartâ€™s desire;
Remove this load of guilty woe,
Nor let me in my sins expire!

I tremble, lest the wrath divine,
Which bruises now my wretched soul,
Should bruise this wretched soul of mine
Long as eternal ages roll.

# AND JESUS CRUCIFIED

Vain, delusive world, adieu,
With all of creature good;
Only Jesus I pursue,
Who bought us with His blood.
All thy pleasures I forego,
I trample on thy wealth and pride;
Only Jesus shall I know,
And Jesus crucified!

Other knowledge I disdain,
â€™Tis all but vanity;
Christ, the Lamb of God, was slain,
He tasted death for me.
Me to save from endless woe
The sin atoning victim died;
Only Jesus shall I know,
And Jesus crucified!

# WEEPING SAVIOR

Did Christ o’er sinners weep?
And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of penitential grief
Burst forth from ev’ry eye.

The Son of God in tears
The wond’ring angels see;
Be thou astonished, O my soul;
He shed those tears for thee.

He wept that we might weep;
Each sin demands a tear;
In heav’n alone no sin is found,
And there’s no weeping there.

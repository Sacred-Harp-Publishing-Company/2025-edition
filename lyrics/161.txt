Come away to the skies,
My beloved, arise,
And rejoice in the day thou wast born:
On this festival day,
Come exulting away,
And with singing to Zion return.
Now with singing and praise
Let us spend all the days
By our heavenly Father bestowed,
While His grace we receive
From His bounty, and live
To the honor and glory of God.

For the glory we were
First created to share,
Both the nature and kingdom divine!
Now created again
That our lives may remain
Throughout time and eternity Thine.
Hallelujah we sing
To the heavenâ€™s high King,
And His rapturous praises repeat;
To the Lamb that was slain,
Hallelujah again
Sing, all heaven, and fall at His feet.

# MY SHEPHERD GUIDES

The Lord my precious Shepherd is,
He guides me day by day;
If I but trust His holy word,
In paths of right I’ll stay.
I’ll fear no evil if He leads,
Beside the waters still;
He anoints my head with oil so sweet,
My cup with joy He fills.

Though I walk through the valley dark,
No shadows will befall;
Thy rod, Thy staff, they comfort me;
Thou art my God, my all.
Surely Thy goodness and Thy love,
Thy mercy free on call,
Will keep me safe from sin and strife;
I’ll praise Thee, Lord of all.

# CORINTH

Jesus! and shall it ever be,
A mortal man ashamed of Thee?
Ashamed of Thee whom angels praise,
Whose glories shine through endless days.

Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon
Let midnight be ashamed of noon;
’Tis midnight with my soul till He,
Bright morning star, bids darkness flee.

Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far
Let evening blush to own a star;
He sheds the beams of light divine
O’er this benighted soul of mine.

Ashamed of Jesus, that dear Friend
On whom my hopes of heav’n depend!
No, when I blush, be this my shame,
That I no more revere His name.

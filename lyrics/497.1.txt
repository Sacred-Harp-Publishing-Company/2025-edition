Bleeding hearts defiled by sin,
Jesus Christ can make you clean;
Contrite souls with guilt oppressed,
Jesus Christ can give you rest.

[chorus]
Sweet Redeemer from above,
Borne on wings of love.

You that mourn your follies past,
Precious hours and years laid waste,
Turn to God, O turn and live;
Jesus Christ can still forgive.

Fainting souls in peril’s hour,
Yield not to the Tempter’s pow’r;
On the risen Lord rely;
Jesus Christ now reigns on high.

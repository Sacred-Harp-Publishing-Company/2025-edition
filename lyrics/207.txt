# LOUISIANA

Come, little children, now we may
Partake a little morsel,
For little songs and little ways
Adorned a great apostle.
A little drop of Jesus’ blood
Can make a feast of union;
It is by little steps we move
Into a full communion.

A little faith doth mighty deeds,
Quite past all my recounting;
Faith, like a little mustard seed,
Can move a lofty mountain.
A little charity and zeal,
A little tribulation,
A little patience makes us feel
Great peace and consolation.

A little cross with cheerfulness,
A little self-denial,
Will serve to make our troubles less,
And bear the greatest trial.
The Spirit like a little dove
On Jesus once descended;
To show His meekness and His love,
The emblem was intended.

The title of the little Lamb
Unto our Lord was given;
Such was our Savior’s little name,
The Lord of earth and heaven.
A little voice that’s small and still
Can rule the whole creation;
A little stone the earth shall fill,
And humble ev’ry nation.

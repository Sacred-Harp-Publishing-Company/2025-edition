# PASSING AWAY

And must I be to judgment brought
And answer in that day
For ev’ry vain and idle thought
And ev’ry word I say?

[chorus]
We are passing away
To that great judgment day.

Yes, ev’ry secret of my heart
Shall shortly be made known
And I receive my just desert
For all that I have done.

How careful, then, ought I to be,
With what religious fear,
Who such a strict account must give
For my behavior here.

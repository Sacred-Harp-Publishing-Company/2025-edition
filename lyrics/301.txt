# GREENLAND

With songs and honors sounding loud,
Address the Lord on high;
Over the heav’ns He spreads His clouds,
And waters veil the sky.
He sends His show’rs of blessings down
To cheer the plains below;
He makes the grass the mountains crown,
And corn in valleys grow.

His steady counsels change the face
Of each declining year;
He bids the sun cut short his race
And wintry days appear.
On us His providence has shone,
With gentle shining rays;
Oh, may our lips and lives make known
His goodness and His praise.

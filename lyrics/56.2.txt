# VILLULIA

“Mercy, O Thou Son of David!”
Thus poor blind Bartimeus prayed;
“Others by Thy grace are saved,
Now to me afford Thine aid.”

Money was not what he wanted,
Though by begging used to live;
But he asked, and Jesus granted,
Alms which none but He could give.

“Lord, remove this grievous blindness,
Let mine eyes behold the day!”
Straight he saw, and, won by kindness,
Followed Jesus in the way.

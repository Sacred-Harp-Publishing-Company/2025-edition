# HAPPY CHRISTIAN

Oh, how happy are they
Who their Savior obey
And have laid up their treasures above;
Tongue can never express
The sweet comfort and peace
Of a soul in its earliest love.

That sweet comfort was mine
When the favor divine
I first found in the blood of the Lamb;
When at first I believed,
What true joy I received,
What a haven in Jesus’ sweet name.

’Twas a heaven below
My Redeemer to know,
And the angels could do nothing more
Than to fall at His feet
And the story repeat
And the lover of sinners adore.

# SAVE, MIGHTY LORD

Jesus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
Save, mighty Lord,
He whom I fix my hopes upon,
Save, mighty Lord.

[chorus]
O, save, save, mighty Lord,
And send converting power down,
Save, mighty Lord.

The way the holy prophet went,
Save, mighty Lord,
The road that leads from banishment,
Save, mighty Lord.

The King’s highway of holiness,
Save, mighty Lord,
I’ll go, for all His paths are peace,
Save, mighty Lord.

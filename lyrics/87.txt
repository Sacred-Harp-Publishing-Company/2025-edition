# SWEET CANAAN

Oh, who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
I’m bound fair Canaan’s land to see,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

[chorus]
O Canaan, sweet Canaan,
I’m bound for the land of Canaan;
Sweet Canaan, ’tis my happy home,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

I’ll join with those who’re gone before,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
Where sin and sorrow are no more,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

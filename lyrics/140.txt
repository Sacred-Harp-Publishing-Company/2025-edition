# MORENO

Farewell, dear brethren of the Lord,
And I cannot tarry here with you!
Yet we believe His gracious word,
And I cannot tarry here with you!

[chorus]
I want to hear the story,
And I want to go in glory!
The gospel sounds the jubilee!

Farewell, my earthly friends below,
And I cannot tarry here with you!
My Savior calls, and I must go,
And I cannot tarry here with you!

Farewell to all below the sun,
And I cannot tarry here with you!
The path is straight my feet shall run,
And I cannot tarry here with you!

# CUSSETA

Show pity, Lord; O Lord, forgive;
Let a repenting rebel live:
Are not Thy mercies large and free?
May not a sinner trust in Thee?

My crimes, though great, cannot surpass
The pow’r and glory of Thy grace;
Great God, Thy nature hath no bound;
So let Thy pard’ning love be found.

Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,
Whose hope, still hov’ring round Thy word,
Would light on some sweet promise there,
Some sure support against despair.

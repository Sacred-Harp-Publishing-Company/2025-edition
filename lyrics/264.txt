# NIGHT SONG

Great troubles with tumultuous noise
Like swelling seas around me spread;
Thy rising waves drown all my joys,
And roll tremendous oâ€™er my head.
Yet will the Lord provide His love
When I address His throne by day,
Nor in the night His grace remove;
The night shall hear me sing and pray.

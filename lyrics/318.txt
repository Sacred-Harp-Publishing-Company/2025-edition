# PRESENT JOYS

We thank the Lord of heav’n and earth,
Who hath preserved us from our birth,

[chorus]
For present joys, for blessings past,
And for the hope of heav’n at last.

How shall we half our task fulfill?
We thank Thee for Thy mind and will,

Redeemed us oft from death and dread,
And with Thy gifts our table spread,

# I WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN

I want to go to heav’n, I do,
I want to see His face,
I want to hear Him sweetly say,
Come dwell with me at home.

[chorus]
I’m going home to be with Christ,
To live through endless days,
And there with saints and angels join
In hymns of joyful praise.

I want to work each day I live,
And do my Master’s will,
A life of faithful service give,
My mission to fulfill.

[chorus, treble]
I’m going home to Christ,
I’m going home to be with Him,
To live through endless days,
And there with saints and angels join
In hymns of joyful praise.

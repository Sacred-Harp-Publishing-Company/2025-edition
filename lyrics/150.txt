# AMITY

How pleased and blest was I
To hear the people cry,
“Come, let us seek our God today!”
Yes, with a cheerful zeal
We haste to Zion’s hill,
And there our vows and honors pay.

May peace attend thy gate,
And joy within thee wait,
To bless the soul of ev’ry guest;
The man that seeks thy peace,
And wishes thine increase,
A thousand blessings on him rest.

# CARMARTHEN

Rejoice! the Lord is King:
Your Lord and King adore;
Mortals, give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

Rejoice in glorious hope!
Jesus the Judge shall come
And take His servants up
To their eternal home:
We soon shall hear the angelâ€™s voice,
The trump of God shall sound: Rejoice!
The trump of God shall sound: Rejoice!

# SABBATH MORNING

Come, let us join with one accord,
In hymns around the throne;
This is the day our risen Lord
Hath made and called His own.

[chorus]
Then let us in His name sing on,
And hasten that great day
When our Redeemer shall come down,
And shadows pass away.

This is the day which God hath blest,
The brightest of the sev’n;
A type of everlasting rest,
That saints enjoy in heav’n.

# AT REST

The world can never give
The bliss for which we sigh;
’Tis not the whole of life to live,
Nor all of death to die.

Beyond this vale of tears
There is a life above,
Unmeasured by the flight of years,
An endless life of love.

Farewell, dear friends, farewell
For just a little while;
We’ll meet and sing on heaven’s shore,
Where parting comes no more.

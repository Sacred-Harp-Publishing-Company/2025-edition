# ROLL JORDAN

He comes! He comes! the Judge severe,
Roll, Jordan, roll;
The seventh trumpet speaks Him near,
Roll, Jordan, roll.

[chorus]
I want to go to heav’n, I do,
Hallelujah, Lord;
We’ll praise the Lord in heav’n above,
Roll, Jordan, roll.

His lightnings flash, His thunders roll,
Roll, Jordan, roll;
How welcome to the faithful soul!
Roll, Jordan, roll.

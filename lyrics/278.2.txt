# TRAVELING PILGRIM

Farewell, vain world, I’m going home,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.
My Savior smiles and bids me come,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.

[chorus]
To the land, to the land,
To the land I am bound,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.

Sweet angels beckon me away,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.
To sing God’s praise in endless day,
Where there’s no more stormy clouds to rise.

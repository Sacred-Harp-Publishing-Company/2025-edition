# LORD, WE ADORE THEE

Holy Lord, we worship Thee,
Thine are we eternally;
Yielded in Thy presence bow,
Let us share Thy favor now.

[chorus]
Holy Lord, holy Lord,
We have met in sweet accord;
As we bow before Thy shrine,
Make us, Savior, wholly Thine.

God of glory, powâ€™r, and grace,
Dying for the human race,
May we heed Thy service call,
Till the evening shadows fall.

# MY LIFE AND BREATH

He saw me sinking in distress,
And flew to my relief;
For me He bore the shameful cross,
And carried all my grief.

[chorus]
To Him I owe my life and breath
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
And saves me from the grave.

To heavâ€™n, the place of His abode,
He brings my weary feet,
Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joys complete.

# IMMENSITY

Within Thy circling pow’r I stand;
On ev’ry side I find Thy hand:
Awake, asleep, at home, abroad,
I am surrounded still with God.

Lord, Thou hast searched and seen me through;
Thine eye commands, with piercing view,
My rising and my resting hours,
My heart and flesh with all their pow’rs.

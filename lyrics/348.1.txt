# AINSLIE

The time is swiftly rolling on
When I must faint and die,
My body to the dust return,
And there forgotten lie.

Let persecution rage around,
And Antichrist appear:
My silent dust beneath the ground,
There’s no disturbance there.

My brother preachers, fare you well,
Your fellowship I love;
In time no more I shall you see,
And soon we’ll meet above.

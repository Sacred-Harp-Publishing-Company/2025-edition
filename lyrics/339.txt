# WHEN I AM GONE

Shed not a tear o’er your friend’s early bier,
When I am gone;
Smile when the slow-tolling bell you shall hear,
When I am gone.
Weep not for me as you stand round my grave,
Think who has died His beloved to save,
Think of the crown all the ransomed shall wear,
When I am gone.

Plant you a rose that shall bloom o’er my grave,
When I am gone;
Sing a sweet song such as angels may have,
When I am gone.
Praise ye the Lord that I’m freed from all care,
Pray ye the Lord that my joys ye shall share,
Look up on high and believe that I’m there,
When I am gone.

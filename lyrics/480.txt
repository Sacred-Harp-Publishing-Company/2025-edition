# REDEMPTION

There upon the cross of Calvary
Our blessed Savior died;
There between two thieves our blessed Lord
For us was crucified.

[chorus]
Oh, His blood was shed that we might live
With Him when life is o’er,
And upon the clouds of glory ride
Safe to that peaceful shore.

Oh! He suffered there for guilty man,
His life so freely gave,
When He paid the debt we could not pay
And triumphed o’er the grave.

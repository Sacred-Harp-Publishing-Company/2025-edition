# SERMON ON THE MOUNT

And seeing, and seeing the multitudes, He went
Up into a mount; and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him.
He opened His mouth; there blessings poured out to the children about, and none were left out.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see the kingdom of heavâ€™n.
The meek He blessed with righteousness; the weak, the dumb, the blind ones too, will sing to His praise when we all reach home.

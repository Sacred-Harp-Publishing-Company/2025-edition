Why do we mourn departing friends,
Or shake at death’s alarms?
’Tis but the voice that Jesus sends
To call them to His arms.

Why should we tremble to convey
Their bodies to the tomb?
There the dear flesh of Jesus lay,
And vanished all the gloom.

Thence He arose, ascended high,
And showed our feet the way;
Up to the Lord our souls shall fly
At the great rising day.

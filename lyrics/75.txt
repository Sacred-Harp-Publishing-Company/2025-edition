# I WOULD SEE JESUS

I would see Jesus when the flow’rs
Of joy adorn my way,
When sunshine and when hope surrounds
My path from day to day.
When friends I cherish most are near,
And hearts encircle mine,
Then, Father, would I turn from all
To lean alone on Thine.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Behold, I freely give
The living water, thirsty one;
Stoop down and drink and live!”
I came to Jesus and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“I am this dark world’s light;
Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright!”
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my star, my sun;
And in that light of life I’ll walk,
Till trav’ling days are done.

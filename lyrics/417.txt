# WEEPING PILGRIM

You may tell them, father, when you see them—
I’m a poor, mourning pilgrim, I’m bound for Canaan’s land.
You may tell them, mother, when you see them—
I’m a poor, mourning pilgrim, I’m bound for Canaan’s land.

[chorus]
I weep, and I mourn, and I move slowly on—
I’m a poor, mourning pilgrim, I’m bound for Canaan’s land.

You may tell them, brothers, when you see them—
I’m a poor, mourning pilgrim, I’m bound for Canaan’s land.
You may tell them, sisters, when you see them—
I’m a poor, mourning pilgrim, I’m bound for Canaan’s land.

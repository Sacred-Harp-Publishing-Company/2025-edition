# LAWRENCEBURG

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fearless through deathâ€™s iron gate,
Nor feel the terrors as she passed.
Jesus can make a dying bed
Feel soft as downy pillows are,
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out sweetly there.

[note to typesetters: no commas; only difference from the treatment at the end of the song is a comma after "there"]
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out sweetly there,

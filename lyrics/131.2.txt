# INVOCATION

Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
Thy better portion trace;
Rise from transitory things
To heav’n, thy native place.
Sun and moon and stars decay,
Time shall soon this earth remove;
Rise, my soul, and haste away
To seats prepared above.

Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn,
Press onward to the prize;
Soon our Savior will return,
Triumphant in the skies.
Yet a season, and you know,
Happy entrance will be giv’n,
All our sorrows left below,
And earth exchanged for heav’n.

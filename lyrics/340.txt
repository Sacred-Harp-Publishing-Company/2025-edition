# ODEM

Wonderful things of men are said
When they have passed away;
Flowers adorn the narrow bed
Over the lifeless clay.

[chorus]
Give me the roses while I live,
Something to cheer me on;
Useless the flowers you may give
After the soul is gone.

Life is the time for words of praise,
Hands clasp with friendly smile;
Blessings to cheer a pilgrimâ€™s days
Are always well worthwhile.

# HOLY CITY

There is a holy city,
A happy world above,
Beyond the starry regions,
Built by the God of love,
An everlasting temple,
And saints arrayed in white;
They serve their great Redeemer,
And dwell with Him in light.

It is no world of trouble,
The God of peace is there;
He wipes away their sorrows,
He banishes their care;
Their joys are still increasing,
Their songs are ever new;
They praise th’eternal Father,
The Son and Spirit, too.

And what shall be my journey,
How long I’ll stay below,
Or what shall be my trials,
Are not for me to know;
In ev’ry day of trouble
I’ll raise my thoughts on high;
I’ll think of the bright temple,
And crowns above the sky.

# PARTING FRIENDS

Farewell, my friends, I’m bound for Canaan,
I’m trav’ling through the wilderness;
Your company has been delightful,
You, who doth leave my mind distressed.
I go away, behind to leave you,
Perhaps never to meet again;
But if we never have the pleasure,
I hope we’ll meet on Canaan’s land.

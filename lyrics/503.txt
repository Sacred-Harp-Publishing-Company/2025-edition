My Savior and my King,
Thy beauties are divine;
Thy lips with blessing overflow,
And ev’ry grace is Thine.

The smilings of Thy face,
How amiable they are!
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine embrace,
And nowhere else but there.

Nor earth nor all the sky
Can one delight afford—
No, not a drop of Thy real joy,
Without Thy presence, Lord.

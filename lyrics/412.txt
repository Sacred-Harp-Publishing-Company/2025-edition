# NEW HOSANNA

Wake, O my soul, and hail the morn,
For unto us a Savior’s born;
See how the angels wing their way
To usher in the glorious day.

[chorus]
Glory, glory, let us sing,
While heav’n and earth His praises ring,
Hosanna,
Hosanna to the Lamb of God.

Hark! what sweet music, what a song,
Sounds from the bright celestial throng!
Sweet song, whose melting sounds impart
Joy to each raptured list’ning heart.

Come, join the angels in the sky,
Glory to God who reigns on high:
Let peace and love on earth abound,
While time revolves and years roll round.

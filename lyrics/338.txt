# SAWYERâ€™S EXIT

How bright is the day when the Christian
Receives the sweet message to come,
To rise to the mansions of glory,
And be there forever at home,

[verse 1 chorus]
And be there forever at home,
And be there forever at home,
To rise to the mansions of glory,
And be there forever at home.

The angels stand ready and waiting,
The moment the spirit is gone,
To carry it upward to heaven,
And welcome it safely at home,

[verse 2 chorus]
And welcome it safely at home,
And welcome it safely at home,
To carry it upward to heaven,
And welcome it safely at home.

The saints that have gone up before us
All raise a new shout as we come,
And sing hallelujah the louder
To welcome the travelers home,

[verse 3 chorus]
To welcome the travelers home,
To welcome the travelers home,
And sing hallelujah the louder,
To welcome the travelers home.

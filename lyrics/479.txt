# CHESTER

Let the high heav’ns your songs invite,
Those spacious fields of brilliant light,
Where sun and moon and planets roll,
And stars that glow from pole to pole.

Sun, moon and stars convey Thy praise
Round the whole earth and never stand:
So, when Thy truth began its race,
It touched and glanced on ev’ry land.

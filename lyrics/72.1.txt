# THE WEARY SOUL

Ye weary, heavy-laden souls,
Who are oppressed and sore,
Ye trav’lers through the wilderness
To Canaan’s peaceful shore,
Through chilling winds and beating rains,
And waters deep and cold,
And enemies surrounding us,
Take courage and be bold.

Farewell, my brethren in the Lord,
Who are for Canaan bound,
And should we never meet again
Till Gabriel’s trump shall sound,
I hope that I shall meet you there
On that delightful shore,
In mansions of eternal bliss,
Where parting is no more.

# THE CHRISTIAN WARFARE

I find myself placed in a state of probation,
Which God has commanded us well to improve.
And I am resolved to regard all His precepts,
And on in the way of obedience to move.
I know I must go through great tribulation,
And many sore conflicts on every hand;
But grace will support and comfort my spirit,
And I shall be able forever to stand.

Iâ€™m called to contend with the powers of darkness,
And many sore conflicts I have to pass through.
O Jesus, be with me in every battle,
And help me my enemies all to subdue.
If Thou, gracious Lord, will only be with me,
To aid and direct me, then all will be right;
Apollyon, with all his powerful forces,
In Thy name and Thy strength shall soon put to flight.

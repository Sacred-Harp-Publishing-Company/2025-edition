# HEAVENLY VISION

I beheld, and lo a great multitude, which no man could number,
Thousands of thousands, and ten times thousands
Stood before the Lamb, and they had palms in their hands, and they cease not day nor night, saying,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
Which was, and is, and is to come.
And I heard a mighty angel flying through the midst of heavâ€™n, crying with a loud voice:
Woe, woe, woe
Be unto the earth by reason of the trumpet which is yet to sound.
And when the last trumpet sounded, the great men and nobles, rich men and poor, bond and free, gathered themselves together, and cried to the rocks and mountains to fall upon them and hide them from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne:
For the great day of the Lord is come, and who shall be able to stand?
And who shall be able to stand?

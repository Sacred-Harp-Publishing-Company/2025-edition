# ENOCH

When overwhelmed with grief
My heart within me dies,
Helpless, and far from all relief,
To heav’n I lift mine eyes.

O lead me to the Rock
That’s high above my head,
And make the covert of thy wings
My shelter and my shade.

Within thy presence, Lord,
Forever I’ll abide;
Thou art the tow’r of my defense,
The refuge where I hide.

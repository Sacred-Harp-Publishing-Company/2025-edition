# CLAMANDA

Say, now, ye lovely social band,
Who walk the way to Canaan’s land,
Ye who have fled from Sodom’s plain,
Say, do you wish to turn again?

O have you ventured to the field,
Well armed with helmet, sword, and shield?
And shall the world, with dread alarms,
Compel you now to ground your arms?

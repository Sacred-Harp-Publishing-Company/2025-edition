# CORONATION

All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name,
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race,
A remnant weak and small,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall;
We’ll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all.

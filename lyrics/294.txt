# ROCKY ROAD

I’m enlisted on the road,
I’m almost done traveling,
Enlisted on the road,
I’m almost done traveling,
I’m bound to go where Jesus is.
My soul shall ascend where Jesus is
To enjoy the peaceful home of rest,
I’m bound to go where Jesus is
And be there forever blest.

[chorus]
It’s a mighty rocky road,
I’m almost done traveling,
A mighty rocky road,
I’m almost done traveling,
I’m bound to go where Jesus is.

I’ve a father on the road,
He’s almost done traveling,
A father on the road,
He’s almost done traveling,
He’s bound to go where Jesus is.
His soul shall ascend where Jesus is
To enjoy the peaceful home of rest,
He’s bound to go where Jesus is
And be there forever blest.

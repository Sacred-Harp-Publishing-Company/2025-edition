# SOUNDING JOY

Behold the morning sun
Begins his glorious way;
His beams through all the nations run,
And life and light convey.

But when the gospel comes
It spreads diviner light;
It calls dead sinners from their tombs,
And gives the blind their sight.

My gracious God, how plain
Are Thy directions giv’n!
Oh, may I never read in vain,
But find the path to heav’n.

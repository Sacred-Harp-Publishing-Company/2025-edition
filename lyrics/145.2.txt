# SWEET AFFLICTION

In the floods of tribulation,
While the billows o’er me roll,
Jesus whispers consolation
And supports my fainting soul.

[chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, praise the Lord!

Wearing there a weight of glory,
Still the path I’ll ne’er forget,
But, exulting, cry, it led me
To my blessed Savior’s feet.

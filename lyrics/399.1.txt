# THE DYING FRIEND

Young people, hear me as your friend,
Whose days on earth are at an end;
Your talents to the Savior lend
And live forevermore.

His Word will guide you here below;
Great love and mercy He will show;
And then with Jesus you may go
And live forevermore.

With you no longer I may dwell,
But His great love for you I tell;
Iâ€™m ready now to bid farewell
And live forevermore.

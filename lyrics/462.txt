# FAITH AND HOPE

What shall I do? shall I lie down
And sink in deep despair?
Will He forever wear a frown,
Nor hear my feeble prayer?
No, He will put His strength in me,
He knows the way I’ve strolled,
And when I’m tried sufficiently
I shall come forth as gold.

When I can read my title clear
To mansions in the skies,
I’ll bid farewell to ev’ry fear
And wipe my weeping eyes.
When we’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.

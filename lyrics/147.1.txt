# BOYLSTON

My God, my life, my love,
To Thee, to Thee I call;
I cannot live if Thou remove,
For Thou art all in all.

Thy shining grace can cheer
This dungeon where I dwell;
’Tis paradise when Thou art here,
If Thou depart, ’tis hell.

The smilings of Thy face,
How amiable they are!
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine embrace,
And nowhere else but there.

To Thee, and Thee alone,
The angels owe their bliss;
They sit around Thy gracious throne,
And dwell where Jesus is.

Not all the harps above
Can make a heav’nly place,
If God His residence remove,
Or but conceal His face.

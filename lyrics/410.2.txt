# MUTUAL LOVE

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above?
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love?
When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin?
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in?

But now I am a soldier,
My Captain’s gone before;
He’s given me my orders,
And bids me ne’er give o’er.
His promises are faithful—
A righteous crown He’ll give,
And all His valiant soldiers
Eternally shall live.

# ROCKPORT

My soul, be on thy guard;
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.
O watch and fight and pray;
The battle ne’er give o’er;
Renew it boldly ev’ry day,
And help divine implore.

Ne’er think the vict’ry won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
The arduous work will not be done
Till thou obtain thy crown.
Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God;
He’ll take thee at thy parting breath
To His divine abode.

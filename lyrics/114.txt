# SAINT’S DELIGHT

When I can read my title clear
To mansions in the skies,
I’ll bid farewell to ev’ry fear,
And wipe my weeping eyes.

[chorus]
I feel like, I feel like
I’m on my journey home.

Should earth against my soul engage,
And fiery darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,
And face a frowning world.

Let cares like a wild deluge come,
Let storms of sorrow fall,
So I but safely reach my home,
My God, my heav’n, my all.

There I shall bathe my weary soul
In seas of heav’nly rest,
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast.

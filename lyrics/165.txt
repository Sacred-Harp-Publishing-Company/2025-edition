# FAMILY BIBLE

How painfully pleasing the fond recollection
Of youthful connection and innocent joy,
While blest with parental advice and affection,
Surrounded with mercy and peace from on high.
I still view the chairs of my father and mother,
The seats of their offspring, as ranged on each hand,
And the richest of books, which excels ev’ry other,
The family Bible that lay on the stand,
The richest of books, which excels ev’ry other,
The family Bible that lay on the stand.

The Bible, that volume of God’s inspiration,
At morning and evening could yield us delight.
The prayers of our father, a sweet invocation,
For mercy by day and for safety at night.
O hymns of thanksgiving with harmonious sweetness,
As warmed by the hearts of the family band,
Hath raised us from earth to that rapturous dwelling,
Described in the Bible that lay on the stand,
Hath raised us from earth to that rapturous dwelling,
Described in the Bible that lay on the stand.

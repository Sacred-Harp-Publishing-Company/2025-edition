# GARDEN HYMN

The Lord into His garden comes,
The spices yield a rich perfume,
The lilies grow and thrive;
Refreshing show’rs of grace divine
From Jesus flow to ev’ry vine,
And make the dead revive.

Come, brethren, you who love the Lord,
Who taste the sweetness of His word,
In Jesus’ ways go on;
Our troubles and our trials here
Will only make us richer there,
When we arrive at home.

# GWEHELOG

I love to see the Lord below,
His church displays His grace;
But upper worlds His glory know,
And view Him face to face.

I love to worship at His feet,
Though sin annoy me there;
But saints, exalted near His seat,
Have no assaults to fear.

I love to meet Him in the courts,
And taste His heav’nly love;
But still His visits seem too short,
Or I too soon remove.

He shines and I am all delight;
He hides, and all is pain:
When will He fix me in His sight,
And ne’er depart again!

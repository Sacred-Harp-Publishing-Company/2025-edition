# PEACE AND JOY

In the cross of Christ I glory,
Tow’ring o’er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sacred story
Gathers round its head sublime.
When the woes of life o’ertake me,
Hopes deceive and fears annoy,
Never shall the cross forsake me;
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

When the sun of bliss is beaming
Light and love upon my way,
From the cross the radiance streaming
Adds more luster to the day.
Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure
By the cross are satisfied;
Peace is there that knows no measure,
Joys that from all time abide.

[repetitions of last line in alto part, verse 1]
Lo! it glows with peace and joy,
It glows with peace and joy,
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

[repetitions of last line in alto part, verse 2]
Joys that from all time abide,
That from all time abide,
Joys that from all time abide.

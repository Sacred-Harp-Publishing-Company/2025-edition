# LOWNDES

The morning walks upon the earth,
And man awakes to toil and mirth;
All living things and lands are gay—
Dear God, walk with me through the day.
Sweet is the breathing of the world,
As in Thy love it lies enfurled,
And blue and clear th’immortal sky;
’Tis Thine, and Thine its purity.

Now noon sits throned; her golden urn
Pours forth the sunshine! Laugh and burn
Cornland and meadow, lake and sea!
Lord of my life, pour love on me.
Slow comes the evening o’er the hill;
The labor of the world is still;
Homeward I go, and muse of Thee—
Father of home, abide with me.

# ESTER

Awake, my soul, in joyful lays,
And sing thy great Redeemer’s praise;
He justly claims a song from me,
His loving-kindness, O how free!

Though num’rous hosts of mighty foes,
Though earth and hell my way oppose,
He safely leads my soul along,
His loving-kindness, O how strong!

When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has gathered thick and thundered loud,
He near my soul has always stood,
His loving-kindness, O how good!

Soon shall I pass death’s gloomy vale,
Soon all my mortal pow’rs must fail;
O may my last expiring breath
His loving-kindness sing in death!

Then let me mount and soar away
To that bright world of endless day,
And sing, with rapture and surprise,
His loving-kindness in the skies.

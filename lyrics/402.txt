# PROTECTION

The Lord my pasture shall prepare,
And feed me with a shepherdâ€™s care;
His presence shall my wants supply,
And guard me with a watchful eye.
My noonday walks He shall attend,
My noonday walks He shall attend
And all my midnight hours defend.

With gloomy horrors overspread,
Though in the paths of death I tread,
My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,
For Thou, O Lord, art with me still,
For Thou, O Lord, art with me still;
Thy friendly crook shall give me aid,
And guide me through the dreadful shade.

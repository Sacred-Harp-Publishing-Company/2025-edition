# THE RESURRECTION DAY

Oh, Resurrection Day!
When Christ the Savior comes some morning fair,
The grave will open wide
And saints will rise to meet Him in the air.

[chorus]
Oh! may we meet in heav’n
To sing the praises of our Lord and King,
And gathered round the snow-white throne
Make heaven’s portals ring.

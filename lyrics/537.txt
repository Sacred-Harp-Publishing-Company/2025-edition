# PORTSMOUTH

Come, sinners, to the gospel feast;
Let ev’ry soul be Jesus’ guest;
Ye need not one be left behind,
For God hath bidden all mankind.

Come, all ye souls by sin oppressed,
Ye restless wand’rers after rest!
Yield to His love’s resistless pow’r,
And fight against your God no more.

This is the time, no more delay;
This is the glorious gospel day:
Come in this moment at His call,
And live for Him who died for all.

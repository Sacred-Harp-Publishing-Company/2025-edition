# WELLS

Life is the time to serve the Lord,
The time t’insure the great reward;
And while the lamp holds out to burn,
The vilest sinner may return.

Life is the hour that God has giv’n
To escape hell and fly to heav’n;
The day of grace, and mortals may
Secure the blessing of the day.

The living know that they must die,
But all the dead forgotten lie;
Their mem’ry and their sense is gone,
Alike unknowing and unknown.

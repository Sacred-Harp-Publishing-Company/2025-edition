# THE AMERICAN STAR

The spirits of Washington, Warren, Montgomery
Look down from the clouds with bright aspect serene.
Come, soldiers, a tear and a toast to their mem’ry,
Rejoicing they’ll see us as they once have been.
To us the high boon by the gods has been granted
To spread the glad tidings of liberty far.
Let millions invade us, we’ll meet them undaunted,
And conquer or die by th’American Star.

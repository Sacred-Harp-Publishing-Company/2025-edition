# NEVER PART

Come, humble sinner, in whose breast
A thousand thoughts revolve;
Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed,
And make this last resolve.

[chorus]
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
And soon shall hear the trumpet sound,
And then all shall with Jesus reign,
And never, never part again.
What? never part again?
No, never part again,
And soon shall hear the trumpet sound,
And never, never part again.

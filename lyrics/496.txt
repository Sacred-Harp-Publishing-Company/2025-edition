# THE ROCK THAT IS HIGHER THAN I

Convinced as a sinner, to Jesus I come,
Informed by the gospel for such there is room;
O’erwhelmed with sorrows for sin I will cry,
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I,

[chorus]
Higher than I, higher than I,
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

When sorely afflicted and ready to faint,
Before my Redeemer I’ll spread my complaint;
Mid storms and distresses my soul shall rely
On Jesus, the rock that is higher than I,

’Tis there with the chosen of Jesus, I long
To dwell and eternally join in the song,
And praising and blessings, with angels on high,
It’s Jesus, the rock that is higher than I,

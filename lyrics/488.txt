# RADIANCE

Thou lovely source of true delight,
Whom I unseen adore!
Unveil Thy beauties to my sight,
That I may love Thee more.
Thy glory oâ€™er creation shines,
But in Thy sacred Word
I read in fairer, brighter lines
My bleeding, dying Lord.

Jesus! my Lord, my life, my light,
O come with blissful ray;
Break radiant through the shades of night,
And chase my fears away.
Then shall my soul with rapture trace
The wonders of Thy love;
But the full glories of Thy face
Are only known above.

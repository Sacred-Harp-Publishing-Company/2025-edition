# THE CHILD OF GRACE

How happy’s ev’ry child of grace
Who feels his sins forgiv’n;
This world, he cries, is not my place;
I seek a place in heav’n:
A country far from mortal sight;
Yet, oh! by faith I see
The land of rest, the saints’ delight,
A heav’n prepared for me.

Oh, what a blessed hope is ours!
While here on earth we stay,
We more than taste the heav’nly pow’rs
And antedate that day.
We feel the resurrection near,
Our life in Christ concealed,
And with His glorious presence here
Our earthen vessels filled.

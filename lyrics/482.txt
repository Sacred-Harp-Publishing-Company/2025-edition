# MULBERRY GROVE

My sands of life are running fast,
I can’t recall one moment past;
I’ve much to do in little space,
O can I yet be saved by grace?
O can I yet one effort make?

Thus far the Lord has led me on,
And I am near my final home;
So I must halt, recount my thoughts,
And tell the world I’m saved by grace;
This effort is my choice to make.

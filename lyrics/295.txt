Day of judgment, day of wonders!
Hark! the trumpet’s awful sound,
Louder than a thousand thunders,
Shakes the vast creation round!
How the summons
Will the sinner’s heart confound.

At His call the dead awaken,
Rise to life from earth and sea;
All the pow’rs of nature shaken
By His looks prepare to flee:
Careless sinner!
What will then become of thee?

# HEAVENLY DOVE

Come, Holy Spirit, heav’nly Dove,
With all Thy quick’ning pow’rs,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
In these cold hearts of ours.

Come, Holy Spirit, heav’nly Dove,
With all Thy quick’ning pow’rs,
Come, shed abroad a Savior’s love,
And that shall kindle ours.

[The first two lines of verse 2 are different in some printings. Jesse has confirmed that this reading is the correct one.—MJW]

# HEAVENLY ANTHEM

The heavens declare the glory of God;
The firmament showeth His handiwork.
Day unto day uttâ€™reth speech;
Night unto night showeth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
Moreover, by them is Thy servant warned.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart
Be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.

I cannot bear Thine absence, Lord,
My life expires if Thou depart;
Be thou, my heart, still near my God,
And Thou, my God, be near my heart.

I was not born for earth or sin,
Nor can I live on things so vile;
Yet I would stay my Father’s time,
And hope and wait for heav’n awhile.

Then, dearest Lord, in Thine embrace
Let me resign my fleeting breath,
And, with a smile upon my face,
Pass the important hour of death.

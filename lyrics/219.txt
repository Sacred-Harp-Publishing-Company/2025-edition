# HE HATH SAVED US

Jesus is our great salvation,
Worthy of our best esteem;
He has saved this congregation;
Join to sing aloud to Him:

[chorus]
He hath saved us, He hath saved us,
Christ alone could us redeem.

Let us never, Lord, forget Thee;
Make us walk as pilgrims here;
We will give Thee all the glory
Of the love that brought us near:

# CHRISTIAN’S HOPE

We have our troubles here below;
We’re trav’ling through this world of woe
To that bright world where loved ones go,
Where all is peace and love,

[verse 1 chorus]
Where all is peace and love,
To that bright world where loved ones go,
Where all is peace and love.

We’re fettered and chained up in clay
While in this body here we stay;
By faith we know a world above,
Where all is peace and love,

[verse 2 chorus]
Where all is peace and love,
By faith we know a world above,
Where all is peace and love.

I feel no way like getting tired;
I’m trusting in His Holy Word
To guide my weary feet above,
Where all is peace and love,

[verse 3 chorus]
Where all is peace and love,
To guide my weary feet above,
Where all is peace and love.

# WOOD STREET

When we, our wearied limbs to rest,
Sat down by proud Euphratesâ€™ stream,
We wept with doleful thoughts oppressed,
And Zion was our mournful theme.

Our harps, that when with joy we sung
Were wont their tuneful parts to bear,
With silent strings neglected hung
On willow trees that withered there.

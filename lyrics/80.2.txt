# SERVICE OF THE LORD

Farewell, vain world, I’m going home;
I am bound to die in the army.
My Savior smiles and bids me come;
I am bound to die in the army.

[chorus]
I am bound to live in the service of my Lord,
I am bound to die in the army.

Sweet angels beckon me away;
I am bound to die in the army.
To sing God’s praise in endless day;
I am bound to die in the army.

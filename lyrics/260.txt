# FAREWELL ANTHEM

My friends, I am going a long and tedious journey,
Never to return.
Fare you well, my friends,
And God grant we may meet together in that world above,
Where trouble shall cease and harmony shall abound.

Hark! hark! my dear friends, for death hath called me,
And I must go, and lie down in the cold and silent grave,
Where the mourners cease from mourning and the prisâ€™ner is set free,
Where the rich and the poor are both alike.
Fare you well, fare you well, my friends.

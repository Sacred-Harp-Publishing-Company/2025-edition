# FROZEN HEART

Lord, shed a beam of heavâ€™nly day
To melt this stubborn stone away,
And thaw with rays of love divine
This heart, this frozen heart of mine.

To hear the sorrows Thou hast felt
All but an adamant would melt;
Goodness and wrath in vain combine
To move this stupid heart of mine.

But One can yet perform the deed;
That One in all His grace I need;
Thy Spirit can from dross refine
And melt this stubborn heart of mine.

O Breath of Life, breathe on my soul!
On me let streams of mercy roll;
Now thaw with rays of love divine
This heart, this frozen heart of mine.

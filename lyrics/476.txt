# ETERNAL AGES

Descend from heavâ€™n, immortal Dove;
Stoop down and take us on Thy wings,
And mount, and bear us far above
The reach of these inferior things:

[chorus]
Beyond, beyond this lower sky,
Up where eternal ages roll,
Where solid pleasures never die,
And fruits immortal feast the soul.

When shall the day, dear Lord, appear,
That I shall mount to dwell above,
And stand and bow among them there,
And view Thy face, and sing, and love?

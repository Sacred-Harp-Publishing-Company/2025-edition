# BEACH SPRING

Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,
Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
Jesus ready stands to save you,
Full of pity, love and pow’r.
He is able, He is able,
He is willing, doubt no more.

Let not conscience make you linger,
Nor of fitness fondly dream;
All the fitness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him.
This He gives you, this He gives you;
’Tis the Spirit’s rising beam.

Agonizing in the garden,
Lo! your Master prostrate lies;
On the bloody tree behold Him;
Hear Him cry before He dies:
“It is finished; it is finished!”
Sinners, will not this suffice?

Lo! th’incarnate God ascended
Pleads the merit of His blood;
Venture to Him, venture wholly;
Let no other trust intrude.
None but Jesus, none but Jesus
Can do helpless sinners good.

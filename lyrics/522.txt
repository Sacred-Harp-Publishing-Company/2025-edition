# YE HEEDLESS ONES

Ye heedless ones who wildly stroll,
The grave will soon become your bed,
Where silence reigns and vapors roll
In solemn darkness round your head.
Your friends will pass this lonesome place
And with a sigh move slowly on,
Still gazing on the spires of grass
With which your graves are overgrown.

# HOLBROOK

When the storms of life are raging,
Stand by me, oh, stand by me.
In the midst of tribulation,
Stand by me, oh, stand by me.
When the world is tossing me
Like a ship upon the sea,
Thou who rulest wind and water,
Stand by me, oh, stand by me.

In the midst of faults and failures,
Stand by me, oh, stand by me.
In the midst of persecution,
Stand by me, oh, stand by me.
When I do the best I can,
And my friends misunderstand,
Thou who knowest all about me,
Stand by me, oh, stand by me.

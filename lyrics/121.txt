# FLORENCE

Not many years their rounds shall roll,
Each moment brings it nigh,
Ere all its glories stand revealed
To our admiring eye.
Ye wheels of nature, speed your course,
Ye mortal pow’rs, decay;
Fast as ye bring the night of death,
Ye bring eternal day.

Ye weary, heavy-laden souls,
Who are oppressed sore,
Ye trav’lers through the wilderness
To Canaan’s peaceful shore,
Through chilling winds and beating rains,
The waters deep and cold,
And enemies surrounding you,
Take courage and be bold.

Though storms and hurricanes arise,
The desert all around,
And fiery serpents oft appear
Through the enchanted ground,
Dark nights and clouds and gloomy fear,
And dragons often roar,
But while the gospel trump we hear,
We’ll press for Canaan’s shore.

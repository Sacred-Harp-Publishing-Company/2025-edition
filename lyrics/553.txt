# ANTHEM ON THE BEGINNING

In the beginning was the Word,
And the Word was with God,
And the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.

All things were made by Him,
And without Him was not any thing made that was made.
In Him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.

There was a man sent from God, whose name was John,
Who came to bear witness of that light,
That all men through Him might believe.
John was not that light,
But was sent to bear witness of that light, the true light that cometh into the world, and the world was made by Him.

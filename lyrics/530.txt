# A GLAD NEW SONG

I’ve learned to sing a glad new song
Of praise unto our King!
And now with all my ransomed pow’rs
His praises I will sing.
I’ve learned to sing the song of peace;
’Tis sweeter ev’ry day,
Since Jesus calmed my troubled soul,
And bore my sins away.

I’ve learned to sing the song of joy;
My cup is running o’er
With blessings full of peace and love,
And still there’s more and more.
Soon I shall sing the glad new song
Of Moses and the Lamb,
With all the sainted hosts above,
Before the great I Am.

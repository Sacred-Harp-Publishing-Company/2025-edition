# WHITE

Ye fleeting charms of earth, farewell,
Your springs of joy are dry.
My soul now seeks another home,
A brighter world on high.

[chorus]
I’m a long time traveling here below,
I’m a long time traveling away from home;
I’m a long time traveling here below
To lay this body down.

Farewell, my friends, whose tender care
Has long engaged my love;
Your fond embrace I now exchange
For better friends above.

# HEBREW CHILDREN

Where are the Hebrew children?
Safe in the promised land.
Though the furnace flamed around them,
God, while in their troubles, found them;
He with love and mercy bound them,
Safe in the promised land.

Where are the twelve apostles?
Safe in the promised land.
They went up through pain and sighing,
Scoffing, scourging, crucifying,
Nobly for their Master dying,
Safe in the promised land.

Where are the holy Christians?
Safe in the promised land.
Those whoâ€™ve washed their robes and made them
White and spotless, pure, and laid them
Where no earthly stain can fade them,
Safe in the promised land.

# KING OF PEACE

Lord, I cannot let Thee go
Till a blessing Thou bestow:
Do not turn away Thy face;
Mine’s an urgent, pressing case.

Dost Thou ask me who I am?
Ah! my Lord, Thou know’st my name:
Yet the question gives a plea
To support my suit with Thee.

Thou didst once a wretch behold,
In rebellion blindly bold,
Scorn Thy grace, Thy pow’r defy;
That poor rebel, Lord, was I.

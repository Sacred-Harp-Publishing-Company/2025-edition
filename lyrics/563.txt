# SUFFIELD

Teach me the measure of my days,
Thou Maker of my frame;
I would survey life’s narrow space,
And learn how frail I am.

A span is all that we can boast,
An inch or two of time;
Man is but vanity and dust
In all his flow’r and prime.

See the vain race of mortals move
Like shadows o’er the plain;
They rage and strive, desire and love,
But all their noise is vain.

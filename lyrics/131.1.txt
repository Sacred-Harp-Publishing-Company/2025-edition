# MESSIAH

He comes, He comes! to judge the world,
Aloud th’archangel cries,
While thunders roll from pole to pole,
And lightnings cleave the skies.
Th’affrighted nations hear the sound,
And upward lift their eyes;
The slumb’ring tenants of the ground
In living armies rise.

Thou awful judge of quick and dead,
The watchful pow’r bestow;
So shall I to my ways take heed,
To all I speak or do.
If now Thou standest at the door,
O let me feel Thee near;
And make my peace with God, before
I at Thy bar appear.

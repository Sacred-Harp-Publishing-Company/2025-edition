# FAMILY CIRCLE

Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

[chorus]
Bless the Lord, O my soul!
Praise the Lord, O my brother!
Shout and sing, O my sister!
Give Him glory, O my father!
And rejoice, O my mother!
And we’ll travel on together,
And we’ll join heart and hands for Canaan.

Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above;
Praise the mount—O fix me on it—
Mount of God’s unchanging love.

Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

# SAMARIA

My spirit looks to God alone,
My rock and refuge is His throne;
In all my fears, in all my straits,
My soul on His salvation waits.
Trust Him, ye saints, in all your ways,
Pour out your hearts before His face;
When helpers fail and foes invade,
God is our all-sufficient aid.

Make not increasing gold your trust,
Nor set your heart on glitt’ring dust;
Why will you grasp the fleeting smoke,
And not believe what God hath spoke?
For sov’reign pow’r reigns not alone,
Grace is the partner of the throne;
Thy grace and justice, mighty Lord,
Shall well divide our last reward.

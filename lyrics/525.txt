I love Thee, my Savior; I love Thee, my Lord;
I love Thy dear people, Thy ways, and Thy word;
With tender emotion I love sinners too,
Since Jesus has died to redeem them from woe.

I find Him in singing; I find Him in prayer;
In sweet meditation He always is near;
My constant companion, O may we neâ€™er part!
All glory to Jesus, He dwells in my heart.

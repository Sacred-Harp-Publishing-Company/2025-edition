# MOUNT VERNON

What solemn sounds the ear invade,
What wraps the land in sorrow’s shade?
From heav’n the awful mandate flies,
The father of his country dies.
Where shall our nation turn its eye,
What help remains beneath the sky?
Our friend, protector, strength, and trust,
Lies low and mold’ring in the dust.

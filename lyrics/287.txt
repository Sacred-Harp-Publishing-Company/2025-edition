# CAMBRIDGE

The Lord will happiness divine
On contrite hearts bestow;
Then tell me, gracious God, is mine
A contrite heart, or no?

I hear, but seem to hear in vain,
Insensible as steel;
If aught is felt, ’tis only pain
To find I cannot feel.

I sometimes think myself inclined
To love Thee, if I could;
But often feel another mind
Averse to all that’s good.

My best desires are faint and few,
I fain would strive for more;
But, when I cry, “My strength renew,”
Seem weaker than before.

Thy saints are comforted, I know,
And love Thy house of prayer;
I sometimes go where others go,
But find no comfort there.

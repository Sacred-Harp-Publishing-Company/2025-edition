# NOTES ALMOST DIVINE

Oh, could I speak the matchless worth,
Oh, could I sound the glories forth,
Which in my Savior shine,
I’d soar and touch the heav’nly strings,
And vie with Gabriel while he sings
In notes almost divine.

Well, the delightful day will come
When my dear Lord will take me home,
And I shall see His face;
Then with my Savior, Brother, Friend,
A blest eternity I’ll spend,
Triumphant in His grace.

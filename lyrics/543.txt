# THOU ART GOD

Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
Through endless years the same.
From everlasting Thou art God,
Through endless years the same.

Under the shadow of Thy throne,
Still may we dwell secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defense is sure.
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defense is sure.

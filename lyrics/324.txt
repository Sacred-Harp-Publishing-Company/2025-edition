Jesus, my all, to heav’n is gone,
Glory, hallelujah;
He whom I fix my hopes upon,
Glory, hallelujah!

[chorus]
I want a seat in paradise,
Glory, hallelujah!
I love that union never dies,
Glory! hallelujah!

His track I see and I’ll pursue,
Glory, hallelujah;
The narrow way till Him I view,
Glory, hallelujah!

Lo! glad I come; and Thou, dear Lamb,
Glory, hallelujah;
Shalt take me to Thee as I am,
Glory, hallelujah!

# HURRICANE CREEK

Awake, my soul, in joyful lays,
Glory, hallelujah,
And sing thy great Redeemer’s praise,
Sing glory, hallelujah.
He justly claims a song from thee,
Glory, hallelujah,
His loving-kindness, O how free!
Sing glory, hallelujah, sing glory, halle, hallelujah.

Though num’rous hosts of mighty foes,
Glory, hallelujah,
Though earth and hell my way oppose,
Sing glory, hallelujah.
He safely leads my soul along,
Glory, hallelujah,
His loving-kindness, O how strong!
Sing glory, hallelujah, sing glory, halle, hallelujah.

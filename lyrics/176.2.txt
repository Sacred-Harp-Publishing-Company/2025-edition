# BLOOMING YOUTH

In the bright season of thy youth,
In nature’s smiling bloom,
Ere age arrives, and trembling waits
Its summons to the tomb.

Remember thy Creator, God;
For Him thy pow’rs employ;
Make Him thy fear, thy love, thy hope,
Thy portion and thy joy.

The Lord will safely guide thy course
O’er life’s uncertain sea,
And bring thee to the peaceful shore,
The heav’n prepared for thee.

# KEDAR

Hard lot of mine, my days are cast
Among the sons of strife,
Whose never-ceasing brawlings waste
My golden hours of life.

O might I fly to change my place,
How would I choose to dwell
In some wide lonesome wilderness,
And leave these gates of hell.

Peace is the blessing that I seek,
How lovely are its charms;
I am for peace, but when I speak,
They all declare for arms.

Should burning arrows smite them through,
Strict justice would approve;
But I had rather spare my foe,
And melt his heart with love.

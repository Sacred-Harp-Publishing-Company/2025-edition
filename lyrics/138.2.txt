# OGLETREE

Frequent the day of God returns
To shed its quick’ning beams;
And yet how slow devotion burns,
How languid are its flames.

Increase, O Lord, our faith and hope,
And fit us to ascend
Where the assembly ne’er breaks up,
And sabbaths never end.

There shall we join, and never tire,
To sing immortal lays,
And, with the bright seraphic choir,
Sound forth Immanuel’s praise.

# THE MIDNIGHT CRY

When the midnight cry began,
O what lamentation,
Thousands sleeping in their sins,
Neglecting their salvation.
Lo, the Bridegroom is at hand,
Who will kindly treat Him?
Surely all the waiting band
Will now go forth to meet Him.

Some, indeed, did wait awhile,
Shone without a rival,
But they spent their seeming oil,
Long since last revival.
Many souls who thought theyâ€™d light,
Oh, when scene was closed,
Now against the Bridegroom fight,
And so they stand opposed.

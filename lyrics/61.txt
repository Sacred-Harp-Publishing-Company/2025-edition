# SWEET RIVERS

Sweet rivers of redeeming love
Lie just before mine eye;
Had I the pinions of a dove,
I’d to those rivers fly.
I’d rise superior to my pain,
With joy outstrip the wind;
I’d cross o’er Jordan’s stormy waves
And leave the world behind.

A few more days, or years at most,
My troubles will be o’er;
I hope to join the heav’nly host
On Canaan’s happy shore.
My raptured soul shall drink and feast
In love’s unbounded sea;
The glorious hope of endless rest
Is ravishing for me.

# RESTORATION

Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

[chorus]
I will rise and go to Jesus,
He’ll embrace me in His arms;
In the arms of my dear Savior,
O there are ten thousand charms.

Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above;
Praise the mount—O fix me on it—
Mount of God’s unchanging love.

# FAREWELL BRETHREN

Brethren, I bid you all farewell,
And from my very heart
Affectionately I do tell
That you and I must part.

And if we part to meet no more
While we on earth remain,
O may we meet on Canaan’s shore,
And never part again.

There shall we join to sing God’s praise,
And all His wonders tell,
And triumph in His holy ways;
So, brethren, fare you well.

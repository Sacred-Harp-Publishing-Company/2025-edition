# JUST FOR A DAY

Just for a day, dear Lord, with Thee,
My soul from earthly care set free:
No other hand to guide my way,
No other voice to answer nay.

There’s naught in life so great as this;
No other one can give such bliss;
’Tis only through our Lord’s command
That we in mercy there may stand.

Only a day, dear Lord with Thee,
And I, Thy servant, glad to be;
Only Thy face just let me see,
And in death’s hour remember me.

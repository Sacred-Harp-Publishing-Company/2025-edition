# BLESSED ROAD

Rise, O my soul, pursue the path
By ancient heroes trod;
Aspiring view those holy men
Who lived and walked with God.
Though dead, they speak in reason’s ear
And in example live;
Their faith and hope and mighty deeds
Still fresh instruction give.

’Twas through the Lamb’s most precious blood
They conquered ev’ry foe,
And to His pow’r and matchless grace
Their crowns and honors owe.
Lord, may I ever keep in view
The patterns Thou hast giv’n,
And ne’er forsake the blessed road
Which led them safe to heav’n.

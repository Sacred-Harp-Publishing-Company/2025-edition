# BISHOP

Our Father’s gone to that bright land;
He dwells with Christ, the King,
And with the saints of old doth stand
While all the angels sing.

Around dear Mother’s bed we stood
And watched her dying face,
While Jesus bade her spirit come
And take a heav’nly place.

Their forms on earth no more we see,
They’re hidden from our view;
Their mem’ries linger still with me
As noble, good, and true.

Could we but stand and view that goal,
’Twould dry our briny tears;
True love and joy there to behold
Would banish all our fears.

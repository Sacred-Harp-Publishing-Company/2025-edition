# STANTON

Brother, rest from sin and sorrow!
Death is oâ€™er, and life is won;
On thy slumber dawns no morrow;
Rest! thine earthly race is run.

[chorus]
Hark! the golden harps are ringing;
Sounds angelic fill the air;
Millions now in heaven singing
Greet our joyful entrance there.

Brother, wake! the night is waning;
Endless day is round thee poured;
Enter thou the rest remaining
For the people of the Lord.

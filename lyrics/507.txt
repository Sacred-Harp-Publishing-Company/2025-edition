# WOODLANDS

Life is a span, a fleeting hour;
How soon the vapor flies!
Man is a tender, transient flow’r,
That e’en in blooming dies.
The once-loved form, now cold and dead,
Each mournful thought employs;
And nature weeps, her comforts fled,
And withered all her joys.

But wait the interposing gloom,
And lo! stern winter flies;
And dressed in beauty’s fairest bloom,
The flow’ry tribes arise.
Hope looks beyond the bounds of time,
When what we now deplore
Shall rise in full immortal prime
And bloom to fade no more.

# SPAN OF LIFE

My span of life will soon be gone,
The passing moments say,
As length’ning shadows o’er the mead
Proclaim the close of day.
O that my heart might dwell aloof
From all created things,
And learn that wisdom from above
Whence true contentment springs.

Ere first I drew this vital breath,
From nature’s prison free,
Crosses in number, measure, weight,
Were written, Lord, for me.
But Thou, my Shepherd, Friend, and Guide,
Hast kindly led me on,
Taught me to rest my fainting head
On Christ, the Cornerstone.

So comforted and so sustained,
With dark events I strove,
And found them rightly understood,
All messengers of love;
With silent and submissive awe,
Adored a chast’ning God,
Revered the terrors of His law,
And humbly kissed the rod.

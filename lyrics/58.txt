Jesus, Thou art the sinnerâ€™s friend,
As such I look to Thee;
Now in the bowels of Thy love,
O Lord, remember me.

[verse 1 chorus]
O Lord, remember me,
O Lord, remember me,
Now in the bowels of Thy love,
O Lord, remember me.

Remember the pure word of grace,
Remember Calvary,
Remember all Thy dying groans,
And then remember me.

[verse 2 chorus]
And then remember me,
And then remember me,
Remember all Thy dying groans,
And then remember me.

Thou wondrous advocate with God,
I yield myself to Thee;
While Thou art sitting on Thy throne,
O Lord, remember me.

[verse 3 chorus]
O Lord, remember me,
O Lord, remember me,
While Thou are sitting on Thy throne,
O Lord, remember me.

And when I close my eyes in death,
And creature helps all flee,
Then, O my great Redeemer, God,
I pray remember me.

[verse 4 chorus]
I pray remember me,
I pray remember me,
Then, O my great Redeemer, God,
I pray remember me.

# JACOB’S VISION

As Jacob with travel was weary one day,
And at night on a stone for a pillow he lay,
There he saw in a vision a ladder so high,
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.

[chorus]
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
And hath raised up a ladder of mercy for me.

The ladder is long, it is strong and well made,
It stood hundreds of years, and is not yet decayed;
Many millions have climbed it and reached Zion’s hill,
And the thousands by faith are now climbing it still.

Come, let us ascend! All may climb it who will,
For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still.
There are regions of light, there are mansions of bliss;
Oh, then, who would not climb such a ladder as this?

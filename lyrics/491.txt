# EAGLES’ WINGS

O glorious hope of perfect love!
It lifts me up to things above,
It bears on eagles’ wings;
It gives my raptured soul a taste,
And makes me for some moments feast
With Jesus’ priests and kings.

No foot of land do I possess,
No cottage in the wilderness,
A poor wayfaring man;
I lodge awhile in tents below,
Or gladly wander as I go,
Till I my Canaan gain.

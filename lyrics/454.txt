# THE BETTER LAND

The road to glory seems so long,
And sorrows often take my song.

[chorus]
I’m going to a better land,
Where troubles are unknown,
All sorrow will be gone;
We’ll sing around the throne in sweet accord,
Adoring Jesus, our dear Lord.

From Jesus’ side I will not stray;
I know He’ll guide me all the way.

I know it is not very far
To heaven where my treasures are.

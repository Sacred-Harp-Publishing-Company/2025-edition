# THE GREAT DAY

I’ve a long time heard that there will be a judgment,
That there will be a judgment in that day.
O there will be a judgment in that day,
O sinner, where will you stand in that day?

I’ve a long time heard that the sun will be darkened,
That the sun will be darkened in that day.
O the sun will be darkened in that day,
O sinner, where will you stand in that day?

I’ve a long time heard that the moon will be bleeding,
That the moon will be bleeding in that day.
O the moon will be bleeding in that day,
O sinner, where will you stand in that day?

I’ve a long time heard that the stars will be falling,
That the stars will be falling in that day.
O the stars will be falling in that day,
O sinner, where will you stand in that day?

I’ve a long time heard that the earth will be burning,
That the earth will be burning in that day.
O the earth will be burning in that day,
O sinner, where will you stand in that day?

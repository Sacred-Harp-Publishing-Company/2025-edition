# LEBANON

See, gracious God, before Thy throne,
Thy mourning people bend;
’Tis on Thy sov’reign grace alone,
On Thee our humble hopes depend.

How changed, alas, are truths divine,
For error, guilt, and shame!
What impious numbers, bold in sin,
Disgrace the holy Christian name!

O turn us, turn us, mighty Lord,
By Thy resistless grace;
Then shall our hearts obey Thy word,
And humbly we shall seek Thy face.

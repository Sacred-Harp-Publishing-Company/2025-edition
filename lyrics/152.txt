# SHEPHERDS REJOICE

Shepherds, rejoice! lift up your eyes,
And send your fears away:
News from the regions of the skies—
A Savior’s born today!
Jesus, the God whom angels fear,
Comes down to dwell with you;
Today He makes His entrance here,
But not as monarchs do.

No gold, nor purple swaddling bands,
Nor royal shining things:
A manger for His cradle stands,
And holds the King of kings.
Go, shepherds, where the infant lies,
And see His humble throne;
The tears of joy in all your eyes,
Go, shepherds, kiss the Son.

Thus Gabriel sang and straight around
The heav’nly armies throng;
They tune their harps to softly sound,
And thus conclude their song:
Glory to God who reigns above,
Let peace surround the earth;
Mortals shall know their Maker’s love
At their Redeemer’s birth.

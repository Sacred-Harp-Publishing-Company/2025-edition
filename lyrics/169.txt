# GODâ€™S HELPING HAND

Lord, let Thy goodness lead our land,
Still saved by Thy almighty hand,
The tribute of its love to bring
To Thee, our Savior and our King.

Thy weary children need Thee still,
Our souls each day with grace to fill;
Be Thou our comfort and our friend,
And lead us safely to the end.

# THE MERCY SEAT

From ev’ry stormy wind that blows,
From ev’ry swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat:
’Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

[chorus]
There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet:
It is the blood-bought mercy seat.

There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friends hold fellowship with friends;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy seat.

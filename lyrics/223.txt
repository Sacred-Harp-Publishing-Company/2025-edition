# BALM IN GILEAD

Long hast thou wept and sorrowed,
Poor mourner, dry thy tears;
Behold, with light and comfort
The God of love appears.

[chorus]
There’s balm in Gilead
To cure a sin-sick soul;
There’s balm in Gilead
To make the wounded whole.

The storm may roar about you,
Your heart may low be laid;
But God is ever near you,
And can you be dismayed?

The seed, before it flourish,
Must low in darkness lie;
And love, to live forever,
Must for a season die.

The glorious light of Zion
Is spreading far and wide,
And sinners now are coming
Unto the gospel tide.

[chorus]
To see the saints in glory,
And the angels stand inviting
To welcome sinners home.

The glory of King Jesus
Triumphant doth arise,
And sinners crowd around it
With bitter groans and cries.

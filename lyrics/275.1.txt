# LOVING-KINDNESS

Awake, my soul, to joyful lays,
Halle, hallelujah!
And sing the great Redeemer’s praise,
Halle, hallelujah!
He justly claims a song from me,
Halle, hallelujah!
His loving-kindness, O how free!
Halle, hallelujah!

He saw me ruined in the fall,
Halle, hallelujah!
Yet loved me notwithstanding all,
Halle, hallelujah!
He saved me from my lost estate,
Halle, hallelujah!
His loving-kindness, O how great!
Halle, hallelujah!

Though num’rous hosts of mighty foes,
Halle, hallelujah!
Though earth and hell my way oppose,
Halle, hallelujah!
He safely leads my soul along,
Halle, hallelujah!
His loving-kindness, O how strong!
Halle, hallelujah!

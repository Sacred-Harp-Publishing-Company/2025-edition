# MORNING SUN

Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By fleeting time or conquâ€™ring death;
Your morning sun may set at noon,
And leave you ever in the dark.
Your sparkling eyes and blooming cheeks
Must wither like the blasted rose;
The coffin, earth, and winding sheet
Will soon your active limbs enclose.

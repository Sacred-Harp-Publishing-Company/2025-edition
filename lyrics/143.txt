# PLEYEL’S HYMN SECOND

While Thee I seek, protecting Pow’r,
Be my vain wishes stilled,
And may this consecrated hour
With better hopes be filled.
Thy love the pow’r of thought bestowed,
To Thee my thoughts would soar;
Thy mercy o’er my life has flowed,
That mercy I adore.

In each event of life, how clear
Thy ruling hand I see!
Each blessing to my soul more dear,
Because conferred by Thee.
In ev’ry joy that crowns my days,
In ev’ry pain I bear,
My heart shall find delight in praise,
Or seek relief in prayer.

When gladness wings my favored hour,
Thy love my thoughts shall fill;
Resigned when storms of sorrow low’r,
My soul shall meet Thy will.
My lifted eye, without a tear,
The gath’ring storm shall see:
My steadfast heart shall know no fear;
That heart shall rest on Thee.

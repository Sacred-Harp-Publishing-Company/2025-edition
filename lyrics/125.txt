# EXPRESSION

O Jesus, my Savior, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the pleasures of earth I resign.
Of objects most pleasing, I love Thee the best;
Without Thee I’m wretched, but with Thee I’m blest.

Thou art my rich treasure, my joy and my love,
None richer possessed by the angels above;
For Thee all the pleasures of sense I forgo,
And wander a pilgrim, despised below.

Thy Spirit first taught me to know I was blind,
And taught me the way of salvation to find.
For when I was sinking in dreadful despair,
My Jesus relieved me and bid me not fear.

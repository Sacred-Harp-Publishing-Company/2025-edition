# CHARLTON

My span of life will soon be gone,
The passing moments say,
As length’ning shadows o’er the mead
Proclaim the close of day.
O that my heart might dwell aloof
From all created things,
And learn that wisdom from above
Whence true contentment springs.

Ere first I drew this vital breath,
From nature’s prison free,
Crosses in number, measure, weight,
Were written, Lord, for me.
But Thou, my Shepherd, Friend, and Guide,
Hast led me kindly on,
Taught me to rest my fainting head
On Christ, the Cornerstone.

# SEND A BLESSING

Oh, tell me no more of this world’s vain store;
The time for such trifles with me now is o’er.
A country I found where true joys abound;
To dwell I’m determined on that happy ground.

[chorus]
Send a blessing,
Send a blessing just now.

The souls that believe in paradise live,
And me in that number will Jesus receive;
My soul, don’t delay—He calls thee away;
Rise, follow thy Savior and bless the glad day.

But this I do find: we two are so joined,
He’ll not live in glory and leave me behind;
So this is the race I’m running through grace
Henceforth—till admitted to see my Lord’s face.

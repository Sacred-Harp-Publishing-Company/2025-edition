# HEAVEN’S MY HOME

Come, all my dear brethren, and help me to sing:
I’m going to Jesus, He’s heaven’s great King;
He died to atone for the sins of the world;
His banner is flying, His sails are unfurled.

[chorus]
Heaven’s my home, heaven’s my home,
I’m going to Jesus, for heaven’s my home.

While here in the valley of conflict I stay,
Oh, give me submission, and strength as my day;
In all my afflictions to Thee would I come,
Rejoicing in hope of my glorious home.

I long, dearest Lord, in Thy beauties to shine,
No more as an exile in sorrow to pine;
And in Thy dear image arise from the tomb,
With glorified millions to praise Thee at home.

# TROUBLES OVER

Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears,
Soon my troubles will be over.
How bright thâ€™unchanging morn appears!
Soon my troubles will be over.

[chorus]
Troubles over,
Soon my troubles will be over.

Farewell, inconstant world, farewell,
Soon my troubles will be over.
Where lights and shades alternate dwell,
Soon my troubles will be over.

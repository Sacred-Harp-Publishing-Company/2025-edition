# CLAYTON

A broken heart, my God, my King,
To Thee a sacrifice I bring;
The God of grace will ne’er despise
A broken heart for sacrifice.

My soul lies humbled in the dust
And owns Thy dreadful sentence just;
Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye,
And save the soul condemned to die.

O may Thy love inspire my tongue!
Salvation shall be all my song;
And all my pow’rs shall join to bless
The Lord, my strength and righteousness.

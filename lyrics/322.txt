# MAN’S REDEMPTION

The glorious plan of man’s redemption
By the Son of God was wrought,
To save the lost and ruined nation
So to heav’n we might be brought.

[chorus]
Glory, honor, and salvation,
To the Lamb, who once was slain;
Sound His praise through ev’ry nation,
May it never cease again.

His precious blood to save us streamed,
Lo! He sends salvation free,
And now the poor by Him redeemed
Find both life and liberty.

And now, dear friends, what more is wanted
Than what is already done?
Christ has to Himself sinners granted;
Will you then to ruin run?

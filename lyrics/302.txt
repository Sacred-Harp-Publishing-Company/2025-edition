# LOGAN

The day is past and gone,
The evening shades appear;
O may we all remember well
The night of death draws near.

[chorus]
And when our days are past
And we from time remove,
O may we in Thy bosom rest,
The bosom of Thy love;
So death will soon disrobe us all
Of what we here possess.

Lord, keep us safe this night,
Secure from all our fears;
May angels guard us while we sleep,
Till morning light appears.

# RELIGION IS A FORTUNE

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above?
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love?
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.

[chorus]
When we all get to heaven,
We will shout aloud and sing,
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.
Religion is a fortune,
And heaven is a home,
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.

When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin?
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in?
Shout glory, halle, hallelujah.

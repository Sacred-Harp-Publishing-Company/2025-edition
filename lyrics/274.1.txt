# THE GOLDEN HARP

Farewell, vain world, I’m going home
To play on the golden harp.
My Savior smiles and bids me come
To play on the golden harp.

[chorus]
To play on the golden harp,
To play on the golden harp.
I want to be where Jesus is,
To play on the golden harp.

Sweet angels beckon me away
To play on the golden harp.
To sing God’s praise in endless day,
To play on the golden harp.

Blow ye the trumpet, blow,
The gladly solemn sound;
Let all the nations know
To earth’s remotest bound:

[chorus]
The year of jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.

Extol the Lamb of God,
The all-atoning Lamb;
Redemption through His blood
Throughout the world proclaim;

The Gospel trumpet hear,
The news of heav’nly grace;
And saved from earth, appear
Before your Savior’s face;

# RETURN AGAIN

Savior, visit Thy plantation;
Grant us Lord, a gracious rain.
All will come to desolation,
Unless Thou return again.

[chorus]
Lord, revive us! Lord, revive us!
All our help must come from Thee;
Lord, revive us! O revive us!
All our help must come from Thee.

Keep no longer at a distance;
Shine upon us from on high.
Lest for want of Thy assistance,
Evâ€™ry plant should droop and die.

# JOURNEY HOME

Oh, who will come and go with me?
I’m on my journey home.
I’m bound fair Canaan’s land to see,
I’m on my journey home.

[chorus]
Oh, come and go with me,
For I’m on my journey home,
Home, sweet home,
Bless the Lord.

Eternal Spirit, we confess,
I’m on my journey home.
And sing the wonders of Thy grace,
I’m on my journey home.

Thy pow’r conveys our blessings down,
I’m on my journey home.
From God the Father and the Son,
I’m on my journey home.

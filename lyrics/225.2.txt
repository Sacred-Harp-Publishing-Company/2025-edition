# CHRISTMAS ANTHEM

Oh, how charming
Are the radiant bands of music, music, music, music!
Oh, how charming
Are the radiant bands of music,
Flying in the air.

The church triumphant gives the tone
While they surround the holy throne,
In glory, with celestial arts,
Angelic armies tune their harps,
And raptured seraphs play their parts:

Strike, strike, strike their notes at our Redeemerâ€™s birth.

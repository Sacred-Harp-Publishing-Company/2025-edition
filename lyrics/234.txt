# REVERENTIAL ANTHEM

Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His name;
Come into His courts,
Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.
Fear before Him, all the earth.
He shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavâ€™ns rejoice,
And the earth be glad before the Lord.
[bass solo] For he cometh,
[tenor solo] For he cometh,
[treble solo] For he cometh
To judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His truth.

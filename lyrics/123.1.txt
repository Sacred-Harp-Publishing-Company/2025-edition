# THE DYING CHRISTIAN

Ye objects of sense and enjoyments of time,
Which oft have delighted my heart,
I soon shall exchange you for views more sublime,
For joys that shall never depart.

Thou, Lord of the day, and thou, Queen of the night,
To me ye no longer are known;
I soon shall behold, with increasing delight,
A sun that shall never go down.

Ye mountains and valleys, groves, rivers and plains,
Thou earth and thou ocean, adieu;
More permanent regions where righteousness reigns
Present their bright hills to my view.

My God, I am Thine;
What a comfort divine,
What a blessing to know that my Jesus is mine!
In the heavenly Lamb
Thrice happy I am,
And my heart it doth dance at the sound of His name.

True pleasures abound
In the rapturous sound,
And whoever hath found it hath paradise found:
My Jesus to know,
And feel His blood flow,
’Tis life everlasting, ’tis heaven below.

Yet onward I haste
To the heavenly feast:
Oh, that is the fullness; but this is the taste!
And this I shall prove,
Till with joy I remove
To the heaven of heavens in Jesus’s love.

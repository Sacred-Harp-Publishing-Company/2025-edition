# WAYFARING STRANGER

I am a poor wayfaring stranger,
While journ’ying through this world of woe;
Yet there’s no sickness, toil nor danger,
In that bright land to which I go.
I’m going there to see my Father,
I’m going there no more to roam;
I’m only going over Jordan,
I’m only going over home.

I know dark clouds will gather o’er me,
I know my way is rough and steep;
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me,
Where God’s redeemed their vigils keep.
I’m going there to see my Mother,
She said she’d meet me when I come;
I’m only going over Jordan,
I’m only going over home.

I want to wear a crown of glory,
When I get home to that good land;
I want to shout salvation’s story,
In concert with the blood-washed band.
I’m going there to meet my Savior,
To sing His praise forevermore;
I’m only going over Jordan,
I’m only going over home.

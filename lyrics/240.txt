# CHRISTIAN SONG

Mine eyes are now closing to rest;
My body must soon be removed,
And moldâ€™ring, lie buried in dust,
No more to be envied or loved.

Ah! what is this drawing my breath,
And stealing my senses away?
O tell me, my soul, is it death,
Releasing me kindly from clay?

Now mounting, my soul shall descry
The regions of pleasure and love;
My spirit triumphant shall fly,
And dwell with my Savior above.

# LOVELY SOCIAL BAND

Say, now, ye lovely social band,
Who walk the way to Canaan’s land,
Ye who have fled from Sodom’s plain,
Say, do you wish to turn again?
O have you ventured to the field,
Well armed with helmet, sword, and shield?
And shall the world, with dread alarms,
Compel you now to ground your arms?

Behold! I see, among the rest,
A host in richer garments dressed,
A host that near His presence stands,
And palms of vict’ry grace their hands.
Say, who are these I now behold,
With blood-washed robes and crowns of gold?
This glorious host is not unknown
To Him who sits upon the throne.

These are the foll’wers of the Lamb;
From tribulation great they came;
And on the hill of sweet repose
They bid adieu to all their woes.
Soon on the wings of love you’ll fly,
To join them in that world on high;
O make it now your chiefest care
The image of your Lord to bear.

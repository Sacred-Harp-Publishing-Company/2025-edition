# FAIRFIELD

Come, humble sinner, in whose breast
A thousand thoughts revolve;
Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed,
And make this last resolve.

I’ll go to Jesus, though my sin
Hath like a mountain rose;
I know His courts, I’ll enter in,
Whatever may oppose.

I can but perish if I go;
I am resolved to try;
For if I stay away, I know,
I must forever die.

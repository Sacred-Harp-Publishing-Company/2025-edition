# LOVE SHALL NEVER DIE

Long have I sat beneath the sound
Of Thy salvation, Lord,
And still how weak my faith is found
And knowledge of Thy word.

How cold and feeble is my love,
How negligent my fears!
How long my hopes of joys above,
How few affections there!

Show my forgetful feet the way
That leads to joys on high,
Where knowledge grows without decay,
And love shall never die.

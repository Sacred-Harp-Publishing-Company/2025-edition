# NEW JORDAN

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.
Oh, the transporting, rapt’rous scene
That rises to my sight!
Sweet fields arrayed in living green,
And rivers of delight.

There gen’rous fruits that never fail
On trees immortal grow;
There rocks and hills, and brooks and vales,
With milk and honey flow.
All o’er those wide, extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away.

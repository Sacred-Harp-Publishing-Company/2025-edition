# Lyrics

This directory contains the proposed lyrics for the 2025 edition of The Sacred Harp. File names correspond to the page number of each hymn in the 2025 edition. Note that, when there are two songs on a page, a `.1` is used for the top of the page, and `.2` for the bottom. For example, `26.txt` contains the text for 26 SAMARIA, `27.1.txt` contains the text for 27t BETHEL, and `27.2.txt` contains the text for 27b ROCHESTER.

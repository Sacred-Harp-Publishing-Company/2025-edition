# DETROIT

Do not I love Thee, O my Lord?
Behold my heart and see,
And turn each cursed idol out
That dares to rival Thee.

Do not I love Thee from my soul?
Then let me nothing love;
Dead be my heart to ev’ry joy
When Jesus cannot move.

Thou know’st I love Thee, dearest Lord,
But O I long to soar
Far from the sphere of mortal joys,
And learn to love Thee more.

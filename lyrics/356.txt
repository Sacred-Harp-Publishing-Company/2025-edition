# BOUNDLESS GRACE

Great God, let all my tuneful powâ€™rs
Awake and sing Thy mighty name;
Thy hand revolves my circling hours,
Thy hand from whence my being came.
Thus will I sing till nature cease,
Till sense and language are no more,
And after death Thy boundless grace
Through everlasting years adore.

# HEBRON

Thus far the Lord hath led me on,
Thus far His pow’r prolonged my days;
And ev’ry evening shall make known
Some fresh memorials of His grace.

Much of my time has run to waste,
And I, perhaps, am near my home;
But He forgives my follies past,
And gives me strength for days to come.

I lay my body down to sleep;
Peace is the pillow for my head,
While well-appointed angels keep
Their watchful stations round my bed.

# FEW HAPPY MATCHES

When Thou, my righteous Judge, shalt come
To take Thy ransomed people home,
Shall I among them stand?
Shall such a worthless worm as I,
Who sometimes am afraid to die,
Be found at Thy right hand?

I love to meet Thy people now,
Before Thy feet with them to bow,
Though vilest of them all;
But can I bear the piercing thought:
What if my name should be left out
When Thou for them shalt call?

O Lord, prevent it by Thy grace,
Be Thou my only hiding place,
In this accepted day;
Thy pardâ€™ning voice, oh, let me hear
To still my unbelieving fear,
Nor let me fall, I pray.

# CROSS OF CHRIST

The cross of Christ inspires my heart
To sing redeeming grace;
Awake, my soul, and bear a part
In my Redeemer’s praise.
Oh, who can be compared to Him
Who died upon the tree?
This is my dear delightful theme,
That Jesus died for me.

A glorious band, the chosen few,
On whom the Spirit came,
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
And mocked the cross and flame;
O God, to us may grace be giv’n
To follow in their train.
Through peril, toil, and pain they climbed
The steep ascent to heav’n.

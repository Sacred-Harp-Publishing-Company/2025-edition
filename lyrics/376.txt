# HELP ME TO SING

Ye souls who are bound unto Canaan,
Come join in and help me to sing
The praises of my loving Jesus,
My Prophet, my Priest, and my King.
His name is most sweetly melodious,
’Twill help you most swiftly to move;
While Jesus Himself is the leader,
We’re bound by the cords of His love.

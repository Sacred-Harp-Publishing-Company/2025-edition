How long, Thou faithful God, shall I
Here in Thy ways forgotten lie?
When shall the means of healing be
The channels of Thy grace to me?

Sinners on ev’ry side step in,
And wash away their pain and sin;
But I, a helpless sin-sick soul,
Still lie expiring at the pool.

Thou seest me lying at the pool;
I would, Thou know’st, I would be whole;
O let the troubled waters move,
And minister Thy healing love.

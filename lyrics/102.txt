# FULFILLMENT

See how the Scriptures are fulfilling,
Poor sinners are returning home;
The time that prophets were foretelling,
With signs and wonders now is come.
The gospel trumpets now are blowing
From sea to sea, from land to land;
God’s Holy Spirit down is pouring,
And Christians joining heart and hand.

Ten thousand fall before Jehovah,
For mercy, mercy! loud they cry;
They rise, all shouting “Hallelujah!”
And “Glory be to God on high.”
But many cry, “It’s all disorder,”
And disbelieve God’s holy word;
Yet Christians sing and shout the louder,
“All glory, glory to the Lord.”

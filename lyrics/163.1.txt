# MORNING

He dies, the friend of sinners dies;
Lo, Salem’s daughters weep around;
A solemn darkness veils the skies,
A sudden trembling shakes the ground.

Ye saints approach! the anguish view
Of Him who groans beneath your load;
He gives His precious life for you,
For you He sheds His precious blood.

Here’s love and grief beyond degree:
The Lord of glory dies for men!
But lo, what sudden joys we see!
Jesus the dead revives again.

The rising God forsakes the tomb,
Up to His Father’s court He flies;
Cherubic legions guard Him home
And shout Him welcome to the skies.

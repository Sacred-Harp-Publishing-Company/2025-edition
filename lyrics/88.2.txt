# MOUNT ZION

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

[chorus]
O Christians, praise Him,
Methinks I hear the gospel sounding
For more volunteers.

Jesus, the name that calms my fears,
That bids my sorrow cease;
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears;
’Tis life and health and peace.

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name.

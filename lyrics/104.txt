# THE LOVELY STORY

A story most lovely Iâ€™ll tell,
Of Jesus (O wondrous surprise);
He suffered the torments of hell,
That sinners, vile sinners, may rise;
He left His exalted abode,
When man by transgression was lost;
Appeasing the wrath of a God,
He shed forth His blood as the cost.

O did my dear Jesus thus bleed,
And pity a ruined lost race!
O whence did such mercy proceed,
Such boundless compassion and grace!
His body bore anguish and pain,
His spirit most sunk with the load,
A short time before He was slain,
His sweat was as great drops of blood.

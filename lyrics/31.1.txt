# NINETY-THIRD PSALM

Grace! ’tis a charming sound,
Harmonious to the ear;
Heav’n with the echo shall resound,
And all the earth shall hear.

Grace first contrived the way
To save rebellious man
And all the steps that grace display,
Which drew the wondrous plan.

Grace taught my wand’ring feet
To tread the heav’nly road,
And new supplies each hour I meet,
While pressing on to God.

Grace all the work shall crown
Through everlasting days;
It lays in heav’n the topmost stone,
And well deserves our praise.

# JUBILEE

Hark! the jubilee is sounding,
O the joyful news is come;
Free salvation is proclaimed
In and through God’s only Son.
Now we have the invitation
To the meek and lowly Lamb.
Glory, honor, and salvation;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Come, dear friends, and don’t neglect it,
Come to Jesus in your prime;
Great salvation, don’t reject it,
O receive it, now’s your time;
Now the Savior is beginning
To revive His work again.
Glory, honor, and salvation;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Now let each one cease from sinning,
Come and follow Christ, the way;
We shall all receive a blessing,
If from Him we do not stray;
Golden moments we’ve neglected,
Yet the Lord invites again!
Glory, honor, and salvation;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Let us run our race with patience,
Looking unto Christ the Lord,
Who doth live and reign forever,
With His Father and our God;
He is worthy to be praised,
He is our exalted King.
Glory, honor, and salvation;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Come, dear children, praise your Jesus,
Praise Him, praise Him evermore;
May His great love now constrain us
His great name for to adore.
O then let us join together,
Crowns of glory to obtain.
Glory, honor, and salvation;
Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

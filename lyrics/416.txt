# THE CHRISTIAN’S NIGHTLY SONG

I’ll sing my Savior’s grace,
And His sweet name I’ll praise,
While in this land of sorrow I remain.
My sorrows soon shall end,
And then my soul ascend,
Where freed from trouble, sorrow, sin, and pain.

But oh, and shall I then
Behold the friend of men,
The man who suffered, bled, and died for me?
Who bore my load of sin,
And sorrow, grief, and pain,
To make me happy and to set me free.

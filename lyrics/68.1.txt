# SALEM

He dies, the friend of sinners dies;
Lo, Salem’s daughters weep around;
A solemn darkness veils the skies,
A sudden trembling shakes the ground.

Say, “Live forever, glorious King,
Born to redeem and strong to save!”
Then ask, “O Death, where is thy sting,
And where thy vict’ry, boasting Grave?”

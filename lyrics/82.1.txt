# BOUND FOR CANAAN

O when shall I see Jesus,
And reign with Him above?
And from the flowing fountain
Drink everlasting love?

[chorus]
I’m on my way to Canaan,
To the new Jerusalem.

When shall I be delivered
From this vain world of sin?
And with my blessed Jesus
Drink endless pleasures in?

But now I am a soldier,
My Captain’s gone before;
He’s given me my orders,
And bids me not give o’er.

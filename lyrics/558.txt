# LIVING STREAMS

My Shepherd is the Lord most high,
And all my wants He will supply;
In pastures green He makes me lie,
And leads by streams that never die.
He in His mercy doth restore
My soul when sinking in distress;
For His name’s sake He evermore
Leads me in paths of righteousness.

Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
E’en there no evil shall I fear,
Because Thy presence shall not fail;
Thy rod and staff my soul shall cheer.
For me a table Thou hast spread
Before the faces of my foes;
With oil Thou dost anoint my head,
My cup is full and overflows.

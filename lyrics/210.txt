See the Lord of glory dying!
See Him gasping! hear Him crying!
See His burdened bosom heave!
Look, ye sinners, ye that hung Him,
Look how deep your sins have stung Him!
Dying sinners, look and live.

Bear with patience tribulation,
Overcoming all temptation,
Till the glorious jubilee;
Soon Heâ€™ll come with bursts of thunder,
Then we shall adore and wonder,
Singing on the highest key.

See the blissful scenes before us,
Join the universal chorus,
Bid the flowing numbers rise;
Songs immortal sweetly sounding,
Notes angelic loud rebounding,
Trembling round the vocal skies.

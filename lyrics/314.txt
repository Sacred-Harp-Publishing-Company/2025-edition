# CLEBURNE

All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name,
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

[verse 1 chorus]
And crown Him Lord of all,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race,
A remnant weak and small,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

[verse 2 chorus]
And crown Him Lord of all,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

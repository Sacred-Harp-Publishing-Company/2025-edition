# SWEET MORNING

The happy day will soon appear,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.
When Gabriel’s trumpet you shall hear,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.

[chorus]
Sweet morning,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.

Behold the righteous marching home,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.
And all the angels bid them come,
And we’ll all shout together in that morning.

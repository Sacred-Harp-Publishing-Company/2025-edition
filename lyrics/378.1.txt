# HEAVENLY PORT

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.

[chorus]
We’ll stem the storm, it won’t be long,
The heav’nly port is nigh;
We’ll stem the storm, it won’t be long,
We’ll anchor by and by.

When shall I reach that happy place
And be forever blest?
When shall I see my Father’s face,
And in His bosom rest?

# SARDIS

Come on, my fellow pilgrims, come,
And let us all be hast’ning home;
We soon shall land on yon blest shore,
Where pains and sorrows are no more;
There we our Jesus shall adore,
Forever blest.

No period then our joys shall know,
Secure from ev’ry mortal foe;
No sickness there, no want or pain
Shall e’er disturb our rest again,
When with Immanuel we reign,
Forever blest.

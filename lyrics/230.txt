# CONVERTING GRACE

As pants the hart for cooling streams
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
And Thy refreshing grace.
Oh, for converting grace, and oh,
For sanctifying pow’r;
Lord, we ask in Jesus’ name,
A sweet, refreshing show’r.

For Thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine;
Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,
Thy majesty divine?
Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still, and thou shalt sing
Praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health’s eternal spring.

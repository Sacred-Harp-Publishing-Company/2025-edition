# WEBSTER

Come, we who love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God,
But servants of the heavâ€™nly King
May speak their joys abroad.

The God that rules on high,
That all the earth surveys,
That rides upon the stormy sky
And calms the roaring seas.

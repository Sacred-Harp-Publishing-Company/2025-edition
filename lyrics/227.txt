# ODE OF LIFE’S JOURNEY

I began life’s journey when young,
And the glitt’ring prospect charmed my eyes;
I saw joy after joy successive rise
Along the extended plain.
But soon I found ’twas all a dream,
And learned the fond pursuit to shun,
Where few can reach the purposed aim,
And thousands daily are undone.

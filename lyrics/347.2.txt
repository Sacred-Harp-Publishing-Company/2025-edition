# HUMILITY

In mercy let me live in peace
With Thee and all just men,
So that in age I will not be
Ashamed of what I’ve been.

For, Lord, Thou know’st my inmost thoughts,
And ev’ry deed I do;
I pray Thy mercy may extend
To my transgressions too.

Then, Lord, I pray, if this be true,
And all my sins forgiv’n,
So when I die, I pray that I
May dwell with Thee in heav’n.

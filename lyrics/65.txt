# SWEET PROSPECT

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.

[chorus]
Oh, the transporting, rapt’rous scene
That rises to my sight!
Sweet fields arrayed in living green,
And rivers of delight.

O’er all those wide, extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds or pois’nous breath
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more.

# OH, SING WITH ME!

Oh! sing with me of social spheres
Where breathes in kindness mutual love,
Where no ungentle look appears,
Though faithfulness should ev’n reprove.
Come, sing of all that’s bright and fair
In azure sky and beauteous earth;
Oh! sing of heav’n, our hopes are there,
With treasures of immortal worth.

# THY STRENGTH

Afflicted saint, to Christ draw near,
Thy Savior’s gracious promise hear;
His faithful word declares to thee
That as thy days, thy strength shall be.

Should persecution rage and flame,
Still trust in thy Redeemer’s name;
In fiery trials thou soon shalt see
That as thy days, thy strength shall be.

When called to bear thy weighty cross,
Or sore affliction, pain, or loss,
Or deep distress, or poverty,
Still, as thy days, thy strength shall be.

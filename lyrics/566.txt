# GUM POND

Lord, Thou hast searched and seen me through;
Thine eye commands, with piercing view,
My rising and my resting hours,
My heart and flesh with all their pow’rs.

My thoughts, before they are my own,
Are to my God distinctly known;
He knows the words I mean to speak
Ere from the op’ning lips they break.

If I should try to shun Thy sight
Beneath the spreading veil of night,
One glance of Thine, one piercing ray,
Would kindle darkness into day.

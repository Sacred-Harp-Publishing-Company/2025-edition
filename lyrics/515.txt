# ROCKBRIDGE

My dear Redeemer and my Lord,
I read my duty in Thy Word;
But in Thy life the law appears,
Drawn out in living characters.

Cold mountains and the midnight air
Witnessed the fervor of Thy prayer;
The desert Thy temptations knew,
Thy conflict and Thy vict’ry, too.

Be Thou my pattern; make me bear
More of Thy gracious image here;
Then God, the Judge, shall own my name
Among the foll’wers of the Lamb.

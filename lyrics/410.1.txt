# THE DYING CALIFORNIAN

Lay up nearer, brother, nearer,
For my limbs are growing cold;
And thy presence seemeth nearer,
When thine arms around me fold.

I am dying, brother, dying;
Soon you’ll miss me in your berth,
For my form will soon be lying
’Neath the ocean’s briny surf.

I am going, brother, going,
But my hope in God is strong;
I am willing, brother, knowing
That He doeth nothing wrong.

Hark! I hear the Savior speaking,
’Tis, I know His voice so well;
When I’m gone, O don’t be weeping,
Brother, hear my last farewell.

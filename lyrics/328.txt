# PRAISE GOD

Oh, for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free,
A heart that’s sprinkled with His blood,
So freely shed for me.
Oh, for a heart submissive, meek,
My great Redeemer’s throne,
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone.

Oh, for a humble, contrite heart,
Believing, true and clean,
Which neither life nor death can part
From Him that dwells within.
A heart in ev’ry thought renewed,
And full of love divine,
Perfect, and right, and pure, and good—
A copy, Lord, of Thine.

# SOAR AWAY

I want a sober mind,
An all-sustaining eye,
To see my God above,
And to the heavens fly.

[chorus]
I’d soar away above the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above.

I want a godly fear,
A quick, discerning eye
That looks to Thee, my God,
And sees the tempter fly.

[chorus: treble]
I’d soar away above the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above,
I’d fly,
To see my God above.

[chorus: alto]
I’d soar away above the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above.

[chorus: tenor, bass]
I’d soar away above the sky,
I’d fly, and fly,
To see my God above,
I’d fly, fly, fly,
To see my God above.

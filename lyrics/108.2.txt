# THE TRAVELER

Trav’ler, haste, the night comes on,
Many a shining hour is gone;
Storm is gath’ring in the west,
And you are so far from home.

[chorus]
Oh, come, trav’ler, haste away,
You must walk while it is day;
Oh, come, trav’ler, haste away,
You will find in Christ the way.

Far from home thy footsteps stray;
Christ the life and Christ the way,
Christ the light; yon setting sun
Ere the noon is scarce begun.

Rising tempest sweeps the sky,
Rains descend, the winds are high,
Waters swell, and death and fear
Sets thy path, no refuge near.

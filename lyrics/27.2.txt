# ROCHESTER

Come, let us join our cheerful songs
With angels round the throne;
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
But all their joys are one.

Let all that dwell above the sky,
And air, and earth, and seas,
Conspire to lift Thy glories high,
And speak Thine endless praise.

The whole creation joins in one,
To bless the sacred name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
And to adore the Lamb.

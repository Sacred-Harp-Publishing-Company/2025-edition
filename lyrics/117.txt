# BABYLON IS FALLEN

Hail the day so long expected,
Hail the year of full release:
Zion’s walls are now erected,
And her watchmen publish peace.
Through our Shiloh’s wide dominion,
Hear the trumpet loudly roar;

[chorus]
Babylon is fallen, is fallen, is fallen,
Babylon is fallen to rise no more.

All her merchants stand with wonder,
“What is this that comes to pass?”
Murm’ring like the distant thunder,
Crying, “O alas, alas!”
Swell the sound, ye kings and nobles,
Priests and people, rich and poor;

Blow the trumpet in Mount Zion;
Christ shall come the second time,
Ruling with a rod of iron
All who now as foes combine.
Babel’s garments we’ve rejected,
And our fellowship is o’er;

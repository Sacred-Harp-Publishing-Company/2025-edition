# THE MARCELLAS

Children of the heav’nly King,
As we journey, sweetly sing;
Sing your Savior’s worthy praise,
Glorious in His works and ways.

Fear not, brethren—joyful stand
On the borders of your land;
Jesus Christ, your Father’s Son,
Bids you undismayed go on.

Lord, submissive make us go,
Gladly leaving all below;
Only Thou our leader be,
And we still will follow Thee.

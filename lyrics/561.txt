# CUNNINGHAM

Gently, Lord, O gently lead us
Through this gloomy vale of tears,
Through the changes Thou’st decreed us,
Till our last great change appears.

[chorus]
O refresh us with Thy blessing,
O refresh us with Thy grace;
May Thy mercies, never ceasing,
Fit us for Thy dwelling place.

When temptation’s darts assail us,
When in devious paths we stray,
Let Thy goodness never fail us,
Lead us in Thy perfect way.

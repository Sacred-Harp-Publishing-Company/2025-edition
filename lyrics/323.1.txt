Jesus, grant us all a blessing;
Send it down, Lord, from above;
May we all go home a-praising
And rejoicing in Thy love.

[chorus]
Farewell, brethren, farewell, sisters,
Till we all shall meet again.

Jesus, pardon all our folly,
Since together we have been;
Make us humble, make us holy,
Cleanse us all from evâ€™ry sin.

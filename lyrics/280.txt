# WESTFORD

Far from my thoughts, vain world, be gone!
Let my religious hours alone:
Fain would my eyes my Savior see;
I wait a visit, Lord, from Thee.

My heart grows warm with holy fire,
And kindles with a pure desire.
Come, my dear Jesus, from above,
And feed my soul with heavâ€™nly love.

Blest Jesus, what delicious fare!
How sweet Thine entertainments are!
Never did angels taste above
Redeeming grace and dying love.
